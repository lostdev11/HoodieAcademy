## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration**

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
# Run setup-course-progress-system.sql
```

This creates:
- `course_progress` table
- Helper functions
- Indexes
- RLS policies
- User status columns

### **Step 2: Test A Migrated Course**

1. **Without Wallet:**
   - Courses work in local mode
   - No sync, but functional

2. **With Wallet:**
   - Go to any migrated course
   - Complete a lesson
   - Check Supabase database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM course_progress 
   WHERE wallet_address = 'YOUR_WALLET';
   ```
   - Should see your progress!

3. **Test Cross-Device:**
   - Open same course on different device
   - Should see same progress

---

## 📈 Database Queries

### **View User Progress:**
```sql
SELECT 
  wallet_address,
  course_slug,
  completion_percentage,
  completed_lessons,
  total_lessons
FROM course_progress
WHERE wallet_address = '0x...';
```

### **Course Completion Stats:**
```sql
SELECT 
  course_slug,
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE completion_percentage = 100) as completed_users,
  AVG(completion_percentage) as avg_completion
FROM course_progress
GROUP BY course_slug
ORDER BY avg_completion DESC;
```

### **Most Difficult Lessons** (high dropout):
```sql
SELECT 
  course_slug,
  AVG(completion_percentage) as avg_completion
FROM course_progress
GROUP BY course_slug
HAVING AVG(completion_percentage) < 50
ORDER BY avg_completion ASC;
```

## 🎨 What Makes This Special

### **Hybrid Architecture:**
- **Database** = Source of truth (accurate, persistent)
- **localStorage** = Performance cache (fast, instant)
- **Best of both worlds!**

### **Smart Caching:**
- Cache valid for 5 minutes
- Auto-refresh when stale
- Falls back to database if cache missing
- Updates cache after every API call

### **Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation
- Works offline with cache
- Auto-retry on failure
- Clear error messages
