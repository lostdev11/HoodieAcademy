# Diagnosing the 403 Error

The 403 error is still occurring, but now we have better logging. Let's figure out what's happening.

## Step 1: Restart Your Dev Server

**This is critical!** The changes won't take effect until you restart.

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
# Then start it again:
npm run dev
```

## Step 2: Watch Your Terminal (Server Console)

After restarting, watch your terminal where `npm run dev` is running. When the 403 error occurs, you should see ONE of these:

### Scenario A: You see `üîç [BOUNTY GET] Request received`
This means the request IS reaching our API route. Look for the full error message.

**Possible causes:**
- Database RLS policy still blocking
- Supabase client configuration issue
- Bounty doesn't exist

**Fix:** Check the database error message in the logs

### Scenario B: You see NOTHING
This means the request is NOT reaching our API route at all.

**Possible causes:**
- Next.js middleware blocking it
- Route not properly compiled
- Cache issue

**Fix:** Clear `.next` folder and rebuild

### Scenario C: You see a different error
Check what the error says and we'll fix it.

## Step 3: Run the Test Script

In a NEW terminal (keep the dev server running):

```bash
node test-bounty-api.js
```

This will:
1. Test the specific bounty that's causing the 403
2. Test fetching all bounties
3. Tell you if the bounty exists in your database
4. Show you the exact response

## Step 4: Check Database Directly

Let's verify the bounty exists in Supabase:

1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Go to **Table Editor** ‚Üí `bounties`
3. Search for ID: `b6c9029a-c455-4e76-b176-1f41c167045f`

**If found:** The bounty exists, it's an RLS issue  
**If not found:** The bounty doesn't exist, that's why it's failing

## Step 5: Quick Fix Options

### Option A: The bounty doesn't exist
The 403 might be a red herring. If the bounty doesn't exist, it should be 404 not 403. But either way, you can:
- Ignore it (if it's an old/deleted bounty)
- Find out what's trying to fetch it and remove that code

### Option B: RLS is still blocking
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to make SELECT completely public:

```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS to test
ALTER TABLE bounties DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Try again. If it works, RLS was the issue. Re-enable it:

```sql
ALTER TABLE bounties ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Then we need to fix the policies properly.

### Option C: Clear build cache
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

## What to Report Back

After trying these steps, tell me:

1. **What you see in the terminal** when the 403 happens
2. **Output of the test script**
3. **Does the bounty exist** in the database?
4. **Did disabling RLS** fix it?

This will help me pinpoint the exact issue!

## Quick Summary

```bash
# 1. Restart dev server
npm run dev

# 2. In another terminal, run test
node test-bounty-api.js

# 3. Watch the dev server terminal for logs
# 4. Check Supabase for the bounty
# 5. Report back what you find
```
