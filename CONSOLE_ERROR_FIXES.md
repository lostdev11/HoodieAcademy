# Console Error Fixes - XP API Issues

## Issues Found

Looking at your console logs, I identified these critical issues:

### 1. ‚ùå **500 Errors on XP APIs**
```
api/xp/auto-reward?wallet=qg7pNNZq7qDQuc6Xkd1x4NvS2VM3aHtCqHEzucZxRGA:1 
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)

api/xp/daily-login:1 
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

**Root Cause:** The `user_activity` table doesn't exist in your database, causing the XP tracking APIs to crash.

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Excessive Component Re-rendering**
```
üîÑ [GlobalRefresh] Registered component: user-dashboard-...
üîÑ [GlobalRefresh] Unregistered component: user-dashboard-...
(repeated hundreds of times)
```

**Root Cause:** Dashboard component mounting/unmounting in a loop due to the XP API failures cascading.

## Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ **Fix 1: Added Robust Error Handling to XP APIs**

**File:** `src/app/api/xp/auto-reward/route.ts`

- **Added try-catch** around the GET endpoint for daily XP progress
- **Return safe defaults** when `user_activity` table doesn't exist:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "dailyProgress": {
      "earnedToday": 0,
      "dailyCap": 300,
      "remaining": 300,
      "percentUsed": 0,
      "capReached": false
    },
    "recentActivities": [],
    "tableNotSetup": true
  }
  ```
- **Changed error logging** from throwing exceptions to warning logs
- **Prevents 500 errors** from cascading to the frontend

### ‚úÖ **Fix 2: Fixed Site URL Resolution**

**File:** `src/app/api/xp/daily-login/route.ts`

- **Before:** `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'`
- **After:** Added fallback to `window.location.origin` for better URL resolution
- **Prevents** fetch errors when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is not set

### ‚úÖ **Fix 3: Created SQL Setup Script**

**File:** `setup-user-activity-table.sql`

This script creates the missing `user_activity` table with:
- Proper indexes for fast XP queries
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Maintenance functions for old log cleanup
- Optimized for daily XP cap queries

**To run:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `setup-user-activity-table.sql`
4. Click "Run"

---

## What You Need to Do

### **CRITICAL: Run the SQL Setup Script**

The XP APIs will now **gracefully handle** the missing table, but for full functionality, you need to create it:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Run `setup-user-activity-table.sql`

This will:
- ‚úÖ Stop the 500 errors completely
- ‚úÖ Enable XP tracking and daily caps
- ‚úÖ Allow activity logging
- ‚úÖ Fix the dashboard re-render loop

---

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Before (with errors):
```
‚ùå api/xp/auto-reward: 500 Internal Server Error
‚ùå Error fetching daily XP progress
‚ùå Dashboard constantly re-rendering
‚ùå "Academy Member" showing instead of squad
```

### After (with fixes):
```
‚úÖ api/xp/auto-reward: Returns safe defaults (0 XP earned today)
‚úÖ Dashboard loads smoothly
‚úÖ No 500 errors in console
‚úÖ Squad and profile name show correctly
```

### After Running SQL Script:
```
‚úÖ Full XP tracking works
‚úÖ Daily XP cap (300 XP/day) enforced
‚úÖ Activity logs saved
‚úÖ Recent activities display
‚úÖ Dashboard shows actual earned XP
```

---

## Verification Steps

After running the SQL script, verify everything works:

1. **Refresh your dashboard** - Should load without errors
2. **Check console** - No more 500 errors
3. **Earn some XP** - Complete an action (daily login, bounty, etc.)
4. **Check daily progress** - Dashboard should show XP earned today

### Console should show:
```
‚úÖ UserDashboard: Fetched user profile with squad: [Your Squad]
üèÜ UserDashboard: Fetched user rank: [Your Rank]
üìä UserDashboard: Setting stats: { totalXP: 237, ... }
```

## Additional Notes

### Why the API still works without the table:

I added **graceful degradation** - the APIs return default values instead of crashing. This means:
- Your app won't break
- Users can still use the academy
- XP features just show zeros until the table is created

### Performance Impact:

The excessive re-rendering was caused by:
1. API failures triggering error states
2. Error states causing component remounts
3. Remounts triggering new API calls
4. Creating an infinite loop

With error handling, this loop is broken.
