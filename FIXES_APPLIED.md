# 🔧 Fixes Applied - Build Errors & Duplicate XP

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Build Error: Cannot Reassign Const Variable

**Error:**
```
× cannot reassign to a variable declared with `const`
  const xpAmount = customXPAmount || rewardConfig.xpAmount;
  // Later...
  xpAmount = xpRemaining; // ❌ Error!
```

**Fix:**
Changed `const` to `let` in `src/app/api/xp/auto-reward/route.ts`:
```typescript
// ✅ Now using let
let xpAmount = customXPAmount || rewardConfig.xpAmount;
// Can now be reassigned when capping to daily limit
xpAmount = xpRemaining;
```

---

### 2. ✅ Build Error: Variable Defined Multiple Times

**Error:**
```
× the name `DAILY_XP_CAP` is defined multiple times
  const DAILY_XP_CAP = 300; // Line 190
  const DAILY_XP_CAP = 300; // Line 336 - Duplicate!
```

**Fix:**
Removed duplicate declarations:
```typescript
// Define once at the top
const DAILY_XP_CAP = 300;
let today = new Date();

// Reuse later (no redeclaration)
// Calculate updated daily totals (reuse DAILY_XP_CAP and today from above)
```

### 3. ✅ Daily Login Duplicate XP Bug

**Issue:**
Your user received **7 daily login bonuses on October 9th**:
- 5 XP at 13:12:40
- 5 XP at 13:12:47  
- 5 XP at 13:13:01
- 5 XP at 13:13:08
- 5 XP at 13:13:54
- 5 XP at 13:14:57
- 5 XP at 13:15:52

**Root Cause:**
Old system checked "last 24 hours" but had race conditions and timing issues.

**Fix:**
Replaced with **auto-reward API** that uses proper referenceId-based duplicate prevention:

```typescript
// NEW: Uses auto-reward API with date-based referenceId
await fetch('/api/xp/auto-reward', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    walletAddress,
    action: 'DAILY_LOGIN',
    referenceId: `login_${today}`, // Prevents duplicates
    metadata: { login_date: today }
  })
});
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Can only claim once per day (UTC day)
- ✅ Uses same duplicate prevention as all other XP awards
- ✅ Respects 300 XP daily cap
- ✅ Proper error messages if already claimed

---

### 4. ✅ Dashboard Rank Display

**Enhancement:**
Updated `UserDashboard.tsx` to show accurate rankings:

**Added:**
- Global rank fetched from `/api/leaderboard`
- Squad rank (within user's squad)
- Rank badges (🥇🥈🥉⭐💎) for achievements
- Daily XP progress widget (300 XP cap)
- Link to full leaderboard

**Display Locations:**
1. **XP Stats Card** - Shows "Rank #X" badge next to level
2. **Global Rank Card** - Dedicated card with rank number and leaderboard link
3. **XP Tab** - Shows Level, XP, and Rank side-by-side with achievement badges
4. **Daily Progress** - New widget showing 300 XP daily cap progress

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

### 1. Clean Up Duplicate Login Bonuses

You have 7 duplicate daily login bonuses on Oct 9. You can clean these up with SQL:

```sql
-- Find duplicate daily login bonuses on the same day
WITH duplicates AS (
  SELECT 
    id,
    wallet_address,
    metadata->>'login_date' as login_date,
    created_at,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY wallet_address, metadata->>'login_date' 
      ORDER BY created_at ASC
    ) as rn
  FROM user_activity
  WHERE activity_type = 'daily_login_bonus'
)
-- Keep first one, delete the rest
DELETE FROM user_activity
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM duplicates WHERE rn > 1
);
```

**Result:** Would remove ~30 XP worth of duplicate bonuses (keeps only first login per day)

### 2. Fix Squad Display Discrepancy

Your database shows:
- `squad`: "Unassigned"
- `squad_id`: "speakers"

Update to sync:
```sql
UPDATE users
SET squad = 'Speakers'
WHERE wallet_address = 'qg7pNNZq7qDQuc6Xkd1x4NvS2VM3aHtCqHEzucZxRGA';
```
