# Dashboard Hooks Error Fix

## Problem
User reported: "Still no xp showing on dashboard, it should in all part tyed into everyone that uses xp"

Console showed error:
```
Uncaught Error: Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.
    at updateReducer (react-dom.development.js:16254:1)
    at updateState (react-dom.development.js:16796:1)
    at Object.useState (react-dom.development.js:17653:1)
    at useState (chunk-TWLJ45NZ.js?v=1b6d9dc5:793:25)
    at UserDashboard (UserDashboard.tsx:26:69)
```

## Root Cause
The `UserDashboard.tsx` component was referencing the `BookOpen` icon component (line 565) but it was not imported from `lucide-react`. This caused a rendering error that disrupted React's hook execution order, leading to the "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Missing Import
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx`

Added `BookOpen` to the imports from `lucide-react`:
```typescript
import {
  // ... existing imports
  Activity,
  BookOpen  // ← Added this
} from "lucide-react";
```

### 2. Connected Refresh Function to XP Section
Added the `refreshXP` function to the XPSection component:

**Props Update**:
```typescript
<TabsContent value="xp" className="space-y-4">
  <XPSection 
    profile={xpProfile}
    badges={badges}
    stats={stats}
    walletAddress={walletAddress}
    refreshXP={refreshXP}  // ← Added this
  />
</TabsContent>
```

**Component Signature Update**:
```typescript
function XPSection({ profile, badges, stats, walletAddress, refreshXP }: {
  profile: any;
  badges: any[];
  stats: DashboardStats;
  walletAddress: string;
  refreshXP: () => void;  // ← Added this
}) {
```

### 3. Added Refresh Button to UI
Added a manual refresh button in the XP section:
```typescript
{/* Refresh Button */}
<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
  <Button
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    onClick={refreshXP}
    className="text-xs text-yellow-400 border-yellow-500/50 hover:bg-yellow-500/10"
  >
    <RefreshCw className="h-3 w-3 mr-2" /> Refresh XP
  </Button>
</div>
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Missing Import**: The undefined `BookOpen` component reference caused a render-time error, which disrupted React's internal state and hook execution order
2. **React Hooks Rule**: React requires hooks to be called in the same order on every render. When a component throws an error mid-render, it can cause hook order mismatches
3. **Cascade Effect**: The rendering error prevented the entire dashboard from loading, making it appear that XP was not showing

## Additional Context

This fix complements the earlier XP refresh fixes:
- Cache-busting in `useUserXP`, `useUserTracking`, and `useUserBounties` hooks
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Manual refresh capability via the refresh button
- Server-side dynamic rendering (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`) in the API route

## Testing
After this fix, the dashboard should:
1. ✅ Load without React hooks errors
2. ✅ Display current XP values correctly
3. ✅ Show the XP breakdown with the BookOpen icon
4. ✅ Allow manual refresh via the button
5. ✅ Auto-refresh XP every 30 seconds
