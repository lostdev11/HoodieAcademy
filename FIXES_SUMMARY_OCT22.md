# Fixes Summary - October 22, 2025 🔧

## ✅ What Was Fixed Today

### 1. **Debuggers Removed** 🗑️
Removed temporary debugging components from production code:

#### Removed From Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- ❌ `PfpDebugger` component removed
- ❌ Import statement removed
- ✅ Clean production code

### 2. **Daily Claim Countdown Fixed** ⏱️
Fixed the countdown timer not showing after claiming daily bonus.

#### Problem
- ❌ Countdown timer didn't appear immediately after claiming
- ❌ Timer calculated midnight instead of 24 hours from claim time
- ❌ Required page refresh to see countdown

#### Solution (`src/components/xp/DailyLoginBonus.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Calculate tomorrow for countdown
const tomorrow = new Date();
tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);
tomorrow.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // ❌ Midnight (wrong!)

setStatus(prev => prev ? { 
  ...prev, 
  alreadyClaimed: true,
  nextAvailable: tomorrow.toISOString()
} : prev);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Calculate exactly 24 hours from now for countdown
const now = new Date();
const nextAvailable = new Date(now.getTime() + (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)); // ✅ Exactly 24 hours!

setStatus(prev => prev ? { 
  ...prev, 
  alreadyClaimed: true,
  lastClaimed: now.toISOString(),
  nextAvailable: nextAvailable.toISOString()
} : prev);

// Reload status from API to get accurate nextAvailable time
setTimeout(async () => {
  await loadStatus();
}, 1000);
```

#### What Works Now
✅ Countdown appears immediately after claiming  
✅ Shows exactly 24 hours until next claim  
✅ Timer updates every second  
✅ No page refresh needed  
✅ Accurate time synchronization with API

### 3. **Course API 500 Error Fixed** (From Earlier)
Fixed the courses API returning 500 error.

#### Problem
- ❌ `/api/courses` returning 500 Internal Server Error
- ❌ Admin dashboard courses tab not loading
- ❌ Trying to join non-existent `course_sections` table

#### Solution
- ✅ Removed `course_sections` join from query
- ✅ Simplified query to just select from `courses` table
- ✅ API now works without additional tables

## 🐛 Known Issues (If Any)

### PFP Still Not Showing?
If your profile picture still doesn't show, it could be:

1. **Database Issue**
   ```sql
   -- Check if your PFP is in the database
   SELECT wallet_address, profile_picture 
   FROM users 
   WHERE wallet_address = 'YOUR_WALLET';
   ```

2. **Squad Issue**
   - PFP only shows for "Academy Members" (squad = null)
   - If you're in a squad, you'll see the squad badge instead

3. **Set Test PFP**
   ```sql
   -- Set a test PFP (replace with your wallet)
   UPDATE users 
   SET 
     profile_picture = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1472099645785-5658abf4ff4e?w=150&h=150&fit=crop&crop=face',
     squad = NULL
   WHERE wallet_address = 'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS';
   ```
