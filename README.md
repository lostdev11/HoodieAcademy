## 1. Visual Concept and Layout

The **Hoodie Academy** is a futuristic, hybrid campus merging physical architecture with a digital metaverse hub, accessible via VR/AR. It blends cyberpunk aesthetics (neon-lit glass, purples, blues, greens) with cozy streetwear vibes (hoodie textures, graffiti-style murals). The campus is alive with holographic displays, real-time X feeds, and digital Easter eggs (e.g., hidden memes, QR codes).

### Key Areas
- **Great Hoodie Hall** (Redefined):
  - **Purpose**: A scholarly-degen war room for learning NFTs, meme coins, and crypto culture.
  - **Features**:
    - **NFT Knowledge Hub**: Holographic tutorials on minting/trading (OpenSea, Rarible, Magic Eden) and Hoodie-Verse NFT case studies.
    - **Meme Coin Command Center**: Live dashboard with AI-driven sentiment analysis of meme coins (e.g., HoodieCoin).
    - **Wallet Wall**: Touch-sensitive display of must-have wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, Trust Wallet) with setup guides.
    - **Crypto X Radar**: Curated feed of key X accounts (@VitalikButerin, @CryptoWendyO, @HoodieHustler) with trending hashtags.
    - **AI Productivity Suite**: Hoodie pods run Grok 3 in “Degen Mode” for NFT art prompts, trading simulations, X post scheduling, and whitepaper summaries.
  - **Aesthetic**: Neon-lit walls with crypto memes, hoodie pods as study stations, and a “Rug-Pull Alarm” for crashing coins. Motto: “Learn Hard, HODL Harder.”
- **Dojo of Infinite Threads**: Training ground for crafting viral X posts and NFT designs, with glowing analytics screens.
- **Debate Dome**: Arena for chaotic debates (e.g., “Is a hot dog a sandwich?”) with holographic avatar effects.
- **Pixel Garden**: Digital flora blooms based on community engagement, a serene space for inspiration.
- **NFT Vault**: Underground library for earning/storing blockchain-verified badges (e.g., “Hoodie Scholar”).
