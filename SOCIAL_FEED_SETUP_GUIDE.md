# ðŸš€ Social Feed - Quick Setup Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- âœ… Supabase project set up
- âœ… User authentication working
- âœ… XP system installed

---

## âš¡ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Database Setup

Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Copy the contents of setup-social-feed.sql
# Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
# Click "Run"
```

This creates:
- `social_posts` table
- `social_comments` table
- `social_reactions` table
- `social_post_views` table
- All triggers and indexes

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

The social feed uses `date-fns` for time formatting. Install it:

```bash
npm install date-fns
```

### Step 3: Verify API Routes

The following API routes should now work:
- `/api/social/posts` - Posts management
- `/api/social/comments` - Comments management
- `/api/social/reactions` - Likes/dislikes

### Step 4: Access the Feed

Navigate to: **`/social`**

That's it! Your social feed is live! ðŸŽ‰

### "XP not being awarded"

**Solution:** 
1. Check the XP API is running at `/api/xp/auto-reward`
2. Check the console for XP award errors
3. Verify the action exists in `xp-rewards-config.ts`
