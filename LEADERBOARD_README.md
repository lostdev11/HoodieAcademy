# Hoodie Academy Leaderboard System - Completion-Based Ranking

## Overview

The Hoodie Academy leaderboard has been updated to focus on **course completion percentage** rather than total score. This change ensures that users are ranked based on their actual learning progress and engagement with the course material.

## Key Changes

### 1. Completion-Based Ranking
- **Primary Metric**: Overall completion percentage across all started courses
- **Filtering**: Only users who have started at least one course are shown
- **Sorting**: Users are ranked by completion percentage (highest to lowest)

### 2. New Data Fields

#### LeaderboardUser Interface
```typescript
interface LeaderboardUser {
  // ... existing fields ...
  coursesStarted: number;                    // Number of courses user has started
  overallCompletionPercentage: number;      // Overall completion % across all courses
  totalLessonsCompleted: number;            // Total lessons completed
  totalLessonsAvailable: number;            // Total lessons available in started courses
}
```

#### CourseProgress Interface
```typescript
interface CourseProgress {
  // ... existing fields ...
  started: boolean;                         // Whether user has started this course
}
```

### 3. Updated Scoring Algorithm

The scoring system now prioritizes completion percentage:

```typescript
// Base points for completion percentage (primary ranking factor)
score += Math.round(overallCompletionPercentage * 10); // 10 points per 1% completion

// Bonus points for completed courses
score += coursesCompleted * 100;

// Points for lessons completed
score += totalLessonsCompleted * 20;

// Points for quiz performance
score += quizScore * 5 + 50;

// Achievement and consistency bonuses
score += achievements + consistencyBonus;
```

### 4. UI Updates

#### Leaderboard Page
- **Header**: Updated description to "Real-time rankings based on course completion percentage"
- **Stats Overview**: 
  - Shows "Avg Completion" instead of "Avg Score"
  - Displays completion percentage prominently
- **Sorting Options**: Added "By Completion" as default sort option
- **User Cards**: Display completion percentage instead of total score

#### Leaderboard Cards
- **Main Display**: Shows completion percentage prominently
- **Stats Row**: 
  - Courses Started
  - Courses Completed  
  - Lessons Completed
  - Achievements
- **Progress Bar**: Uses actual completion percentage

#### Current User Stats
- Shows completion percentage instead of total score
- Displays courses started vs completed
- Shows lessons completed count

## How It Works

### 1. User Progress Tracking
- When a user starts a course (any lesson progress), `started: true` is set
- Progress is calculated as: `(lessonsCompleted / totalLessons) * 100`
- Overall completion: `(totalLessonsCompleted / totalLessonsAvailable) * 100`

### 2. Leaderboard Filtering
```typescript
// Only include users who have started at least one course
const activeUsers = users.filter(user => {
  const hasStartedCourses = user.courseProgress.some(course => course.started);
  return hasStartedCourses;
});
```

### 3. Ranking Algorithm
```typescript
// Sort by completion percentage (descending)
activeUsers.sort((a, b) => b.overallCompletionPercentage - a.overallCompletionPercentage);
```

## Benefits

1. **Fair Ranking**: Users are ranked based on actual learning progress
2. **Encourages Engagement**: Rewards consistent course participation
3. **Clear Metrics**: Easy to understand completion percentages
4. **Motivates Learning**: Focuses on educational achievement rather than gaming the system

## Testing

Use the test page at `/test-leaderboard` to:
- Initialize test users
- Simulate lesson completions
- Test quiz completions
- View real-time leaderboard updates
- Reset data for testing

## Migration Notes

- Existing user data will be automatically migrated
- New fields will be calculated from existing progress data
- Users without any course progress will not appear in the leaderboard
- All existing functionality (achievements, badges, etc.) remains intact

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/leaderboardData.ts` - Updated interfaces and calculation functions
- `src/services/leaderboard-service.ts` - Updated service logic
- `src/components/leaderboard/LeaderboardPage.tsx` - Updated UI
- `src/components/leaderboard/LeaderboardCard.tsx` - Updated card display
- `src/app/test-leaderboard/page.tsx` - Updated test interface

### Key Functions
- `getRealLeaderboardData()` - Filters and calculates completion metrics
- `calculateUserScore()` - Updated scoring algorithm
- `getUserRank()` - Now based on completion percentage
- `recalculateUserStats()` - Calculates new completion fields

## Future Enhancements

1. **Course-Specific Rankings**: Separate leaderboards by course category
2. **Time-Based Metrics**: Weekly/monthly completion challenges
3. **Achievement Integration**: Tie achievements to completion milestones
4. **Social Features**: Course completion sharing and celebrations
