# API 500 Errors Fixed - Mentorship & Courses

## Overview
Fixed multiple API errors that were causing 500 and 400 status codes in the admin dashboard, particularly affecting the "Go Live" button and courses loading.

---

## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Go-Live API Error (500)**
**File:** `src/app/api/mentorship/go-live/route.ts`

**Problem:**
Line 127 referenced `permission.role` which was undefined when an admin user tried to go live. The variable `permission` was only defined in the else block for non-admin users, causing a crash.

**Error:**
```
ReferenceError: permission is not defined
```

**Fix:**
Added a new variable `permissionRole` that tracks the role for both admin and presenter paths:

```typescript
// Before (broken)
let hasPermission = false;
let permissionReason = '';

if (adminCheck?.is_admin) {
  hasPermission = true;
  permissionReason = 'Admin access';
} else {
  const permission = permissionData?.[0];
  // ...
}

// Later in code (crashes for admins)
permission_role: permission.role  // ❌ undefined for admins!

// After (fixed)
let hasPermission = false;
let permissionReason = '';
let permissionRole = 'user';  // ✅ Always defined

if (adminCheck?.is_admin) {
  hasPermission = true;
  permissionReason = 'Admin access';
  permissionRole = 'admin';  // ✅ Set for admins
} else {
  const permission = permissionData?.[0];
  hasPermission = permission?.allowed || false;
  permissionReason = permission?.reason || 'Unknown';
  permissionRole = permission?.role || 'presenter';  // ✅ Set for presenters
}

// Later in code (works for everyone)
permission_role: permissionRole  // ✅ Always defined!
```

### 2. ❌ **Wallet Verify API Error (400)**
**File:** `src/app/api/wallet/verify/route.ts`

**Problem:**
The API calls database functions (`verify_wallet_allowed` and `log_wallet_connection`) that may not exist in the database, causing 400 errors.

**Solution:**
Created comprehensive SQL script to set up all required database functions.

---

### 3. ❌ **Courses API Error (500)**
**File:** `src/app/api/courses/route.ts`

**Problem:**
The API requires a wallet address, which we now pass correctly after our previous fix. However, the 500 error may occur if:
- The user doesn't exist in the database
- Database connection issues
- Missing environment variables

**Current State:**
The fix we made earlier (passing wallet_address parameter) should resolve this. The 500 error should be temporary during development.

---

## 🗄️ Database Functions Created

### Created SQL Script: `fix-mentorship-database-functions.sql`

This script creates the following essential functions:

#### 1. **`verify_wallet_allowed(p_wallet_address)`**
- Checks if a wallet is allowed to connect
- Returns: `{allowed, is_admin, reason}`
- Handles:
  - New wallets (allows connection)
  - Banned wallets (denies connection)
  - Existing wallets (checks admin status)

#### 2. **`log_wallet_connection(...)`**
- Logs all wallet connection attempts
- Tracks: IP address, user agent, success/failure
- Automatically creates `wallet_connections` table if needed

#### 3. **`can_user_go_live(p_wallet_address, p_session_id)`**
- Checks if a user can go live for a specific session
- Returns: `{allowed, reason, role}`
- Handles:
  - Admins (always allowed)
  - Session creators (always allowed)
  - Presenters with permissions (allowed if authorized)
  - Others (denied)

#### 4. **`go_live_session(p_session_id, p_wallet_address)`**
- Updates session status to 'live'
- Sets `went_live_at` timestamp
- Returns: `{success, session_id, went_live_at}`

#### 5. **`wallet_connections` Table**
- Stores all wallet connection logs
- Fields: id, wallet_address, action, success, ip_address, user_agent, metadata, created_at
- Includes performance indexes

## 📋 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Database Functions
Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# Copy the contents of fix-mentorship-database-functions.sql
# Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
# Execute the script
```

### Step 2: Verify Functions Work
Test the functions in Supabase:

```sql
-- Test wallet verification
SELECT * FROM verify_wallet_allowed('qg7pNNZq7qDQuc6Xkd1x4NvS2VM3aHtCqHEzucZxRGA');

-- Test go-live permissions (replace with actual session ID)
SELECT * FROM can_user_go_live(
  'qg7pNNZq7qDQuc6Xkd1x4NvS2VM3aHtCqHEzucZxRGA',
  'your-session-id-here'::uuid
);
```

### Step 3: Test the Go Live Button
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard → Live Sessions tab
2. Click on "Sessions" view
3. You should see the "Ready to Go Live" section if you have scheduled sessions
4. Click "Go Live Now" button
5. Confirm the action
6. Session should go live successfully! 🎉

## ✅ What's Fixed

### Go-Live Functionality
- ✅ Admins can now go live without errors
- ✅ Presenters can go live with proper permissions
- ✅ Session creators can go live on their own sessions
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Permission tracking for all roles

### Wallet Verification
- ✅ New wallets are automatically allowed
- ✅ Banned wallets are properly blocked
- ✅ Connection attempts are logged for security
- ✅ Fallback handling if database is unavailable

### Error Handling
- ✅ Proper error messages returned to client
- ✅ Server logs show detailed debugging info
- ✅ Graceful degradation when functions are missing

---

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run the SQL script in Supabase
- [ ] Verify all functions were created successfully
- [ ] Test wallet verification endpoint: `/api/wallet/verify`
- [ ] Test go-live button as admin
- [ ] Test go-live button as presenter (if you have presenter permissions)
- [ ] Check console for any remaining errors
- [ ] Verify session changes to "live" status in database
- [ ] Test "End Session" button after going live

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### If Go-Live Still Fails:

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```
   Look for: 🎬 Go live request
   Should see: ✅ Permission granted
   Then: 🎉 Session is now live!
   ```

2. **Verify Database Functions Exist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name 
   FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
   AND routine_name LIKE '%live%';
   ```

3. **Check Session Status:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, status, went_live_at
   FROM mentorship_sessions
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

4. **Verify User Permissions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT wallet_address, is_admin
   FROM users
   WHERE wallet_address = 'your-wallet-here';
   ```

### Common Issues:

**Error: "Permission check failed"**
- Database function `can_user_go_live` doesn't exist
- Run the SQL script to create it

**Error: "Failed to go live"**
- Database function `go_live_session` doesn't exist
- Session might not exist in database
- Check mentorship_sessions table

**Error: "Permission denied"**
- User is not admin
- User is not session creator
- User doesn't have presenter permissions
- Grant permissions using the Mentorship Manager

| **Session Creator** | ✅ Always | Created the specific session |
| **Presenter** | ✅ Conditional | Entry in `active_presenters` with `can_go_live = true` |
| **Regular User** | ❌ Never | No permissions |
