### 5. Enhanced Submissions Gallery

**File: `src/components/bounty/SubmissionsGallery.tsx`**
- ✅ Improved error handling
- ✅ Better loading states
- ✅ Enhanced debugging logs
- ✅ Robust data validation

**Improvements:**
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 6. Database Schema

**File: `src/lib/user-tracking-schema.sql`**
- ✅ Complete database schema for user tracking
- ✅ All necessary tables and indexes
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ XP management functions
- ✅ Admin checking functions

**Tables Created:**
- `users` - Enhanced user profiles
- `user_xp` - XP tracking
- `user_activity` - Activity logging
- `placement_tests` - Squad placement data
- `submissions` - Enhanced submissions
- `bounty_submissions` - Bounty tracking

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Using the User Tracking Hook

```typescript
import { useUserTracking } from '@/hooks/useUserTracking';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    data, 
    loading, 
    error, 
    recordWalletConnection,
    recordPlacementTest,
    recordBountySubmission 
  } = useUserTracking(walletAddress);

  // Record wallet connection
  const handleWalletConnect = async () => {
    await recordWalletConnection();
  };

  // Record placement test completion
  const handlePlacementTest = async (squad: string, score: number) => {
    await recordPlacementTest(squad, score);
  };

  // Record bounty submission
  const handleBountySubmit = async (bountyId: string, submissionId: string) => {
    await recordBountySubmission(bountyId, submissionId);
  };
}
```

### Direct API Usage

```javascript
// Fetch user tracking data
const response = await fetch(`/api/users/track?wallet=${walletAddress}`);
const userData = await response.json();

// Update user activity
await fetch('/api/users/track', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    walletAddress,
    activityType: 'bounty_submission',
    metadata: { bountyId, submissionId }
  })
});
```

## 🧪 Testing

**File: `test-submissions-and-tracking.js`**
- Comprehensive test suite for all APIs
- Tests submissions fetching
- Tests user tracking functionality
- Tests user sync capabilities
- Tests activity creation

**Run Tests:**
```bash
node test-submissions-and-tracking.js
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- Users can only modify their own data
- Admins have elevated permissions
- Secure data access patterns

### Wallet-Based Authentication
- Wallet address as primary identifier
- No password-based authentication
- Secure wallet connection tracking
- Activity tied to wallet identity
