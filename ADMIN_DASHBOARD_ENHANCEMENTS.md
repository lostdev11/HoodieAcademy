## 2. User Deletion Functionality 🗑️

### What Was Added

Added the ability to **delete users** from the Users tab in the admin dashboard.

### Where to Find It

3. Find the user you want to delete
4. Click the **three dots menu** (⋮) next to the user

### Safety Features

#### Confirmation Dialog
When you try to delete a user, you'll see a confirmation showing:
- User's display name
- Warning about what will be deleted:
  - User profile and data
  - All submissions and activity
  - XP and progress
- **"This action cannot be undone!"** warning

#### Protection
- **Cannot delete yourself** - Admins cannot delete their own account
- **Admin-only** - Only admins can delete users
- **Audit logging** - All deletions are logged

### What Gets Deleted

When you delete a user:
- ✅ User profile (username, display name, bio, etc.)
- ✅ User submissions (bounties, exams, etc.)
- ✅ User activity history
- ✅ XP and progress data
- ✅ Course progress
- ✅ All related data (via cascade delete)

### Activity Logging

Every user deletion is logged in the database:
```sql
SELECT 
  activity_type,
  wallet_address as deleted_by,
  activity_data->>'deleted_user' as deleted_wallet,
  activity_data->>'deleted_user_name' as deleted_name,
  created_at
FROM user_activity
WHERE activity_type = 'user_deleted'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

3. Course visible only to that squad
4. Later can change to "all" squads

1. Spam account created
2. Admin finds it in Users tab
3. Clicks delete

2. Test accounts need cleanup
3. Admin deletes test users
4. Database cleaned up

## Troubleshooting

### Courses Tab Issues

**"No courses found"**
- Check if you have courses in database
- Try clicking Refresh button
- Check browser console for errors

**Hide/Show not working**
- Verify you're an admin
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify Supabase connection

**Filter not working**
- Clear search box
- Try "All Squads" filter
- Refresh the page

### User Deletion Issues

**"Admin access required"**
- Verify `is_admin = true` in database
- Check you're using correct admin wallet

**"Cannot delete your own admin account"**
- This is by design for safety
- Ask another admin to delete your account if needed

**Delete button not appearing**
- Make sure you're in Users tab
- Look for three dots menu (⋮)
- Check that dropdown opens

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Test the courses tab** - Hide and show some courses
2. ✅ **Test user deletion** - Delete a test account
3. ✅ **Check activity logs** - Verify actions are logged
4. ✅ **Train other admins** - Show them the new features
