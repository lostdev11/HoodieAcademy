# Go Live Button Enhancement - Live Sessions Tab

## Overview
Enhanced the "Go Live" functionality in the Live Sessions tab to make it more prominent and user-friendly for admins managing mentorship sessions.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Prop Mismatch Issue
**File:** `src/app/admin-dashboard/page.tsx`

**Problem:** The `MentorshipManager` component was receiving the wrong prop name.
- Component expected: `walletAddress`
- Was receiving: `adminWallet`

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before
<MentorshipManager adminWallet={walletAddress || ''} />

// After
<MentorshipManager walletAddress={walletAddress} />
```

This fix ensures the wallet address is properly passed to enable admin actions like going live, ending sessions, etc.

---

### 2. Added Prominent "Ready to Go Live" Section
**File:** `src/components/admin/MentorshipManager.tsx`

**New Feature:** Created a dedicated, eye-catching section at the top of the Sessions view that displays all scheduled sessions ready to broadcast.

**Features:**
- 🎨 **Gradient background** (red to slate) with pulsing Play icon
- 📊 **Count display** showing number of sessions ready to go live
- 📋 **Quick action cards** for each scheduled session with:
  - Session title
  - Scheduled date/time
  - RSVP count
  - Prominent "Go Live Now" button

**Visual Design:**
- Red accent colors for urgency and visibility
- Shadow effects on buttons for depth
- Pulsing animation on the Play icon
- Only appears when there are scheduled sessions

**Code Added:**
```typescript
{sessions.filter(s => s.status === 'scheduled').length > 0 && (
  <Card className="bg-gradient-to-r from-red-900/40 to-slate-800 border-red-500/30">
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle className="text-xl flex items-center gap-2">
        <Play className="w-5 h-5 text-red-400 animate-pulse" />
        Ready to Go Live
      </CardTitle>
      <CardDescription className="text-gray-300">
        {sessions.filter(s => s.status === 'scheduled').length} session(s) scheduled and ready to broadcast
      </CardDescription>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      // Quick action buttons for each scheduled session
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
)}
```

---

### 3. Enhanced Sessions Tab Button with Live Indicators
**File:** `src/components/admin/MentorshipManager.tsx`

**New Feature:** Added visual badges to the "Sessions" tab button to show status at a glance.

**Indicators:**
1. **🔴 Red Pulsing Badge** - When sessions are LIVE
   - Animated pulsing effect
   - Shows count of live sessions
   - Impossible to miss!

2. **🟠 Orange Badge** - When sessions are scheduled
   - Shows count of scheduled sessions
   - Only appears when no sessions are live

**Visual Effects:**
```typescript
{sessions.filter(s => s.status === 'live').length > 0 && (
  <span className="absolute -top-1 -right-1 flex h-5 w-5">
    <span className="animate-ping absolute inline-flex h-full w-full rounded-full bg-red-400 opacity-75"></span>
    <span className="relative inline-flex rounded-full h-5 w-5 bg-red-500 text-white text-xs items-center justify-center">
      {sessions.filter(s => s.status === 'live').length}
    </span>
  </span>
)}
```
