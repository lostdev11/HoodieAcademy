# Squad and Profile Name Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Squad Selection Delay
**Problem:** After choosing a squad, there was a delay before the lock status showed, and it redirected to dashboard.

**Solution:**
- Update local state immediately after squad save (`setIsLocked`, `setCurrentSquad`, `setRemainingDays`)
- Remove redirect to dashboard - user stays on squad page to see the lock status
- Close confirmation dialog immediately
- Scroll to top to show updated squad card with lock badge
- Dispatch custom `squadUpdated` event for other components

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/choose-your-squad/page.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Badge Not Showing on Home Page
**Problem:** After selecting a squad, the badge didn't update on the home page when navigating back.

**Solution:**
- Add event listeners for `squadUpdated` and `storage` events
- Fetch squad data immediately instead of using setTimeout
- Refresh squad data when events are triggered
- Listen for squad changes in real-time

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`

---

### 3. ✅ "Academy Member" Showing on Dashboard
**Problem:** Dashboard showed "Academy Member" (Unassigned badge) even after squad selection.

**Solution:**
- Fixed broken code structure in UserDashboard component
- Properly structured `initializeDashboard` with `fetchUserProfile`
- Added event listeners for `squadUpdated` and `storage` events
- Dashboard now refreshes when squad is updated

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx`

---

### 4. ✅ Profile Name Not Saving/Reflecting
**Problem:** When users changed their display name, it wasn't reflecting across different pages in the academy.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `/api/users/` GET endpoint to support `walletAddress` query parameter
- Now properly fetches individual user data by wallet address
- Returns default values for users not found in database
- Display name hook (`useDisplayName`) now correctly fetches from database

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/api/users/route.ts`

---

## Technical Changes

### Event System
Implemented a comprehensive event system for real-time updates:

```javascript
// When squad is selected
window.dispatchEvent(new Event('storage'));
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('squadUpdated', { 
  detail: { squad: selectedSquad.name } 
}));

// Listening for updates
window.addEventListener('squadUpdated', handleSquadUpdate);
window.addEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
```

### API Improvements

#### Before:
```typescript
// GET /api/users/ - Only returned all users
```

#### After:
```typescript
// GET /api/users/?walletAddress=xxx - Returns specific user
// GET /api/users/ - Returns all users
```

## How It Works Now

### Squad Selection Flow:
1. User selects squad and clicks "Confirm"
2. **Immediately:**
   - Local state updates (lock status, remaining days)
   - Confirmation dialog closes
   - Success alert shows
   - Page scrolls to top to show locked squad card
3. **In background:**
   - Squad saved to database
   - XP reward granted (+30 XP)
   - Events dispatched to all listening components
4. **All pages update:**
   - Home page badge refreshes
   - Dashboard shows correct squad
   - Sidebar updates squad chat link

### Display Name Flow:
1. User updates display name
2. Saved to `users` table in database
3. Updated in localStorage for immediate UI update
4. Display name hook fetches from database on next load
5. All components using `useDisplayName()` or `useDisplayNameReadOnly()` get updated value

## Testing Checklist

✅ Navigate to home page → Correct squad badge shows  
✅ Check dashboard → Squad name displays correctly (not "Academy Member")  
✅ Update display name → Reflects across all pages  
✅ Open in new tab → Squad and name are correct

## Notes

- No database migrations needed
- Event system works across tabs (storage events)
- Display name changes require a page refresh to reflect (by design - prevents excessive API calls)
