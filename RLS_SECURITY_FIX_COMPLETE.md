# 🔒 RLS Security Issues - FIXED

## What Was Wrong?

Supabase detected **4 critical security issues** with your database:

### 1. ❌ Bounties Table - RLS Not Enabled
- **Problem**: Had RLS policies but RLS was disabled on the table
- **Risk**: Policies weren't being enforced, leaving data vulnerable
- **Fix**: Enabled RLS and verified all policies are active

### 2. ❌ Bounty Submissions Table - No RLS
- **Problem**: Public table with no Row Level Security
- **Risk**: Anyone could read/write/delete submissions directly
- **Fix**: Enabled RLS and created comprehensive policies

### 3. ❌ Active Presenters View - Security Definer
- **Problem**: View used `SECURITY DEFINER` (runs with creator's permissions)
- **Risk**: Could bypass RLS and access restricted data
- **Fix**: Recreated view with `SECURITY INVOKER` (runs with user's permissions)

### 4. ❌ Related Tables Missing RLS
- **Problem**: Mentorship tables lacked proper RLS policies
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to session and permission data
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive RLS policies for all mentorship features

## 🚀 How to Fix

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste: `fix-rls-security-issues.sql`
3. Click **Run** (or press `Ctrl + Enter`)

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

The script includes verification queries at the end that will show:

```sql
-- Shows RLS status for all tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rls_enabled FROM pg_tables...

-- Shows all policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies...
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All tables show `rls_enabled = true`
- ✅ Multiple policies listed for each table
- ✅ No more linter errors in Supabase

### Step 3: Re-run Supabase Linter

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Database** → **Linter**
2. Click **Refresh** or **Re-run Linter**
3. All 4 errors should be **GONE** ✅

- ✅ Users can **only submit as themselves**
- ✅ Users can **update their own** submissions (before approval)
- ✅ Only **admins** can approve/reject/delete submissions

### Mentorship Sessions
- ✅ Public can **read** all sessions
- ✅ **Mentors** can manage their own sessions
- ✅ **Admins** can manage all sessions

### Student Permissions
- ✅ Students can **request** to speak
- ✅ Only **hosts/admins** can approve/deny requests

## 🔍 How RLS Works

### Before (Vulnerable)
```
User → API → Database
         ↓
    No security check!
    Anyone can access anything
```

### After (Secure)
```
User → API → Database
         ↓
    RLS Policy Check ✅
    ├─ Is user admin?
    ├─ Is user the owner?
    └─ Allow or Deny
```

**Every database query** now goes through RLS policies automatically!

## 📋 Quick Verification Checklist

After running the script, verify:

- [ ] Supabase linter shows **0 errors** for RLS
- [ ] Bounties table: `rls_enabled = true`
- [ ] Bounty submissions table: `rls_enabled = true`
- [ ] Active presenters view: No longer shows in linter
- [ ] Can still create bounties as **admin**
- [ ] Cannot create bounties as **regular user**
- [ ] Can submit bounty submissions as **regular user**
- [ ] Cannot approve submissions as **regular user**

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Policy doesn't work - still getting 403"

**Problem**: Your API might not be passing `auth.jwt()` correctly

**Fix**: Ensure your API routes include:
```typescript
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY! // Service key bypasses RLS
);
```

For **user-facing queries**, use:
```typescript
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY! // Enforces RLS
);
```

### "Admin can't do anything now"

**Problem**: Admin status not being recognized

**Fix**: Check that `users.is_admin = true` for your wallet:
```sql
SELECT wallet_address, is_admin FROM users 
WHERE wallet_address = 'YOUR_WALLET_HERE';
```

### "Function auth.jwt() does not exist"

**Problem**: Using wrong Supabase client or missing auth context

**Fix**: 
1. Use `supabase.auth.getUser()` in API routes
2. Pass user context explicitly if needed
3. Or use service key for admin operations
