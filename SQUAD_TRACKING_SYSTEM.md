## Data Flow

### How Squad Tracking Works:

```
User Selects Squad
       ‚Üì
POST /api/user-squad
       ‚Üì
Database Updated
       ‚Üì
squadUpdated Event Dispatched
       ‚Üì
All Components Refresh
       ‚Üì
Squad APIs Fetch New Data
       ‚Üì
UI Updates Everywhere
```

### Squad Data Sources:

1. **Primary:** `/api/user-profile` - Single user data with squad
2. **Members:** `/api/squads/members` - All members of a squad
3. **Rankings:** `/api/squads/rankings` - Squad comparisons
4. **Stats:** `/api/squads/stats` - Detailed squad analytics
5. **Activity:** `/api/squad/activity` - Real-time activity tracking

---

## Use Cases

### 1. **View Your Squad Members**
```tsx
// In any component
import { useSquadMembers } from '@/hooks/useSquadTracking';

const { members, stats } = useSquadMembers(userSquad);

// Display member count
<p>{stats?.totalMembers} members in your squad</p>

// Show top contributor
<p>Top: {stats?.topContributor?.displayName}</p>
```

### 2. **Compare Squad Performance**
```tsx
import { useSquadRankings } from '@/hooks/useSquadTracking';

const { rankings } = useSquadRankings('xp', 'week');

// Find your squad's rank
const mySquadRank = rankings.find(r => r.squad === userSquad)?.rank;
```

### 3. **Show Squad Analytics**
```tsx
import { useSquadStats } from '@/hooks/useSquadTracking';

const { stats } = useSquadStats(userSquad, true);

// Display engagement
<p>Bounty Win Rate: {stats?.engagement.bountyWinRate}%</p>
<p>Posts per Member: {stats?.engagement.avgPostsPerMember}</p>
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations:
- ‚úÖ Efficient database queries with indexes
- ‚úÖ Batch member lookups to reduce API calls
- ‚úÖ Cached responses in React hooks
- ‚úÖ Lazy loading for heavy components
- ‚úÖ Pagination support for large squads
- ‚úÖ Smart re-fetching only when needed

### Database Indexes:
All necessary indexes already exist on:
- `users.squad` - For filtering by squad
- `users.wallet_address` - For joins
- `user_xp.wallet_address` - For XP lookups
- `user_activity.wallet_address, activity_type` - For activity tracking

---

## Real-Time Updates

Squad data auto-refreshes when:
1. User selects/changes squad
2. XP is awarded
3. New member joins squad
4. Member becomes active
5. Bounty is completed
6. Social post is created

**Event System:**
```javascript
// When squad changes
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('squadUpdated', { 
  detail: { squad: 'Creators' } 
}));

// Components listen and refresh
window.addEventListener('squadUpdated', handleSquadUpdate);
```
