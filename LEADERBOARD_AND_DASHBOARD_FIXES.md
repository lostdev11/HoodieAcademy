# Leaderboard and Dashboard Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Users Showing on Leaderboard Based on XP
**Problem**: The leaderboard was potentially ranking users by XP instead of course completion percentage.

**Solutions**:
- Fixed the `enhanced-leaderboard-service.ts` to remove the incorrect `totalXP` field that was being added to LeaderboardUser objects
- The manual fallback query already sorts by `completion` (course completion percentage), not XP
- Created SQL script `fix-leaderboard-rpc-function.sql` to fix the database RPC function `get_leaderboard_rankings()`
  - The RPC function now ranks by: **Completion % â†’ Courses â†’ XP (tiebreaker)**
  - This ensures users with higher course completion always rank higher

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/enhanced-leaderboard-service.ts` - Removed totalXP field from LeaderboardUser mapping

**Database Update Required**:
- Run `fix-leaderboard-rpc-function.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix the RPC function

### 2. âœ… User Dashboard Not Fetching XP Data
**Problem**: The user dashboard wasn't displaying XP data for users.

**Root Causes**:
1. The `useUserXP` hook was only checking `data.stats?.totalXP` but not falling back to `data.user?.total_xp`
2. The dashboard was showing loading state indefinitely if any hook was stuck loading
3. The XP section wasn't handling null/undefined profile data gracefully

**Solutions**:
- **Updated `useUserXP` hook** (`src/hooks/useUserXP.ts`):
  - Now checks both `data.stats?.totalXP` and `data.user?.total_xp` with fallback
  - Added better logging to debug XP data fetching
  
- **Improved `UserDashboard` component** (`src/components/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx`):
  - Changed loading logic to only show skeleton on first load, not on refreshes
  - XP section now uses stats as fallback when profile is null/undefined
  - Used computed `totalXP` variable instead of directly accessing `profile.totalXP`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useUserXP.ts` - Better XP data parsing with fallbacks
- `src/components/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx` - Improved loading states and null handling

### 3. âœ… Admin Dashboard Not Fetching Info
**Problem**: Admin dashboard wasn't displaying user information even though it was refreshing.

**Root Cause**:
The `RobustUserProfile` interface was missing `total_xp` and `level` fields, so even though the database queries were selecting these fields, they weren't being included in the returned user objects.

**Solution**:
- **Updated `RobustUserProfile` interface** (`src/lib/robust-user-sync.ts`):
  - Added `total_xp?: number;` field
  - Added `level?: number;` field
  
- **Updated all user creation methods** to include default XP values:
  - `syncUserOnWalletConnect()` - Sets `total_xp: 0` and `level: 1` for new users
  - `createFallbackUser()` - Sets `total_xp: 0` and `level: 1` for fallback users
  - `tryDirectDatabase()` - Sets `total_xp: 0` and `level: 1` for direct database inserts

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/robust-user-sync.ts` - Added XP fields to interface and all user creation methods

## Summary of Changes

### Frontend Files Modified:
1. âœ… `src/services/enhanced-leaderboard-service.ts` - Fixed leaderboard ranking logic
2. âœ… `src/hooks/useUserXP.ts` - Improved XP data parsing
3. âœ… `src/components/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx` - Better loading and null handling
4. âœ… `src/lib/robust-user-sync.ts` - Added XP fields to user profile interface

### Database Update Required:
- ðŸ”„ **IMPORTANT**: Run `fix-leaderboard-rpc-function.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

## Testing Instructions

### Test Leaderboard:
1. Navigate to `/leaderboard`
2. Verify users are sorted by completion % (not XP)
3. Check that the "Sort by" dropdown defaults to "% Completion"
4. Users with higher course completion should rank higher than users with just high XP

### Test User Dashboard:
1. Connect wallet and navigate to user dashboard
2. Verify XP shows up in the stats cards
3. Check the "XP & Progress" tab shows correct total XP
4. Verify level calculation is correct (Level = floor(totalXP / 1000) + 1)

### Test Admin Dashboard:
1. Log in as admin
2. Navigate to admin dashboard
3. Verify all users show up with their XP and level data
4. Check that the refresh button fetches updated data
5. Verify stats cards show correct totals

## How the Fixes Work

### Leaderboard Ranking:
```typescript
// Primary sort: Completion %
// Secondary sort: Number of courses
// Tertiary sort: Total XP (tiebreaker only)
.sort((a, b) => b.completion - a.completion)
```

### XP Data Flow:
```
Database (users.total_xp) 
  â†’ API (/api/users/track) 
  â†’ Hook (useUserXP) 
  â†’ Dashboard Display
```

### Admin Dashboard Data Flow:
```
Database (users table with total_xp, level)
  â†’ API (/api/admin/users-robust)
  â†’ RobustUserSync (now includes XP fields)
  â†’ Admin Dashboard Display
```

---

## Additional Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- XP defaults to 0 and level defaults to 1 for new users
- Leaderboard now correctly prioritizes course completion over XP accumulation
- Dashboard loading states are much smoother and don't block on individual data fetches

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Run `fix-leaderboard-rpc-function.sql` in Supabase
2. âœ… Test leaderboard to confirm sorting is by completion %
3. âœ… Test user dashboard to confirm XP displays correctly
4. âœ… Test admin dashboard to confirm all user data loads

All frontend code changes are complete and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
