# Wallet Connection Fix - October 14, 2025

## Problem
Wallet connection stopped working due to **multiple conflicting wallet storage systems** that were not synchronized:

### Three Separate Storage Systems:
1. **TokenGate Component** 
   - Location: `src/components/TokenGate.tsx`
   - Storage: `sessionStorage['wifhoodie_verification']`
   - Used for: NFT verification gate

2. **Dashboard Page**
   - Location: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Storage: `localStorage['walletAddress']` and `localStorage['connectedWallet']`
   - Used for: Dashboard wallet display

3. **useWalletSupabase Hook**
   - Location: `src/hooks/use-wallet-supabase.ts`
   - Storage: `localStorage['hoodie_academy_wallet']`
   - Used for: Course pages and admin features

### Why It Broke
When users connected their wallet, it would save to one storage system but other parts of the app were looking in different storage locations. This caused:
- Wallet appearing connected in one component but not another
- Users getting stuck at the connection screen
- Inconsistent authentication state across pages

## Solution Applied

### Updated `TokenGate.tsx` to sync all storage systems:

#### 1. **On Wallet Connect** (Line 469-472)
```typescript
// Sync wallet across all storage systems immediately
localStorage.setItem('hoodie_academy_wallet', walletAddress);
localStorage.setItem('walletAddress', walletAddress);
localStorage.setItem('connectedWallet', walletAddress);
```

#### 2. **After NFT Verification** (Line 237-240)
```typescript
// Sync with other wallet storage systems
localStorage.setItem('hoodie_academy_wallet', wallet);
localStorage.setItem('walletAddress', wallet);
localStorage.setItem('connectedWallet', wallet);
```

#### 3. **On Wallet Disconnect** (Line 349-353)
```typescript
// Clear ALL wallet storage systems
sessionStorage.removeItem(VERIFICATION_SESSION_KEY);
localStorage.removeItem('hoodie_academy_wallet');
localStorage.removeItem('walletAddress');
localStorage.removeItem('connectedWallet');
localStorage.removeItem('hoodie_academy_is_admin');
```

#### 4. **On Session Restore** (Line 276-320)
```typescript
// Check all storage locations for existing wallet
const storedWallet = localStorage.getItem('hoodie_academy_wallet') 
  || localStorage.getItem('walletAddress') 
  || localStorage.getItem('connectedWallet');

// ... restore from any available source
```

## How to Test

1. **Clear your browser storage** (to start fresh):
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Clear all Storage (localStorage + sessionStorage)
   - Refresh the page

2. **Test wallet connection**:
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Approve Phantom connection
   - You should see wallet connected across all pages

3. **Test persistence**:
   - Refresh the page
   - Wallet should remain connected
   - Navigate to different pages - wallet should show everywhere

4. **Test disconnect**:
   - Click disconnect
   - All storage should be cleared
   - You should be logged out everywhere

## What Pages Are Affected

### Pages using TokenGate (NFT verification required):
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/profile` - User profile
- `/wallet-wizardry` - Wallet course
- And other course pages

### Pages using useWalletSupabase hook:
- `/admin-dashboard` - Admin panel
- `/choose-your-squad` - Squad selection
- `/nft-mastery` - NFT course
- `/technical-analysis` - Trading course
- All other course pages

## Files Modified
- `src/components/TokenGate.tsx` - Added storage synchronization

## Future Recommendations

Consider consolidating to a **single wallet management system** using:
1. Create a centralized `WalletProvider` context
2. Use a single storage key
3. Remove duplicate wallet logic from individual pages
4. Let all components consume from the central provider

This would prevent future storage sync issues.

## Quick Troubleshooting

If wallet connection still doesn't work:

1. **Clear browser cache and storage**:
   ```
   DevTools > Application > Clear storage
   ```

2. **Check Phantom is installed**:
   - Phantom extension should be enabled
   - Try refreshing after enabling

3. **Check console for errors**:
   - Open DevTools console
   - Look for red errors during connection
   - Check if wallet address is being logged

4. **Verify localStorage keys**:
   ```javascript
   // In console, check all keys are set:
   localStorage.getItem('hoodie_academy_wallet')
   localStorage.getItem('walletAddress')
   localStorage.getItem('connectedWallet')
   ```

All three should show the same wallet address after connection.
