# Duplicate Users Fix - October 21, 2025

## Problem

You have duplicate user records showing in the admin dashboard's Users tab. This happens when the same `wallet_address` appears multiple times in the `users` table.

## Solution Applied

### 1. âœ… API Deduplication (Immediate Fix)

**File Modified:** `src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts`

Added deduplication logic that keeps only the most recent record for each wallet address. This fixes the display issue immediately without touching the database.

```typescript
// Deduplicate users by wallet_address (keep most recent)
const uniqueUsersMap = new Map();
users.forEach(user => {
  const existing = uniqueUsersMap.get(user.wallet_address);
  if (!existing || new Date(user.updated_at) > new Date(existing.updated_at)) {
    uniqueUsersMap.set(user.wallet_address, user);
  }
});
```

**Result:** Users tab now shows only unique users (keeps most recently updated record).

### 2. ðŸ”§ Database Cleanup (Permanent Fix)

**File Created:** `fix-duplicate-users.sql`

Run this SQL script in Supabase to permanently remove duplicates from the database.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Check the Dashboard

1. Refresh your admin dashboard
2. Go to Users tab
3. The duplicates should now be gone (thanks to API deduplication)

### Step 2: Clean Up Database (Recommended)

1. **Check for duplicates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     wallet_address,
     COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
   FROM users
   GROUP BY wallet_address
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

2. **If duplicates found, run the cleanup script:**
   - Open Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
   - Copy the contents of `fix-duplicate-users.sql`
   - Review the script carefully
   - Execute it

3. **Verify cleanup:**
   ```sql
   SELECT wallet_address, COUNT(*) 
   FROM users 
   GROUP BY wallet_address 
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```
   Should return 0 rows.

## What the Cleanup Does

1. **Identifies Duplicates** - Shows you which wallet addresses have multiple records
2. **Removes Duplicates** - Keeps the most recent record (based on `updated_at`)
3. **Adds Constraint** - Prevents future duplicates with a UNIQUE constraint
4. **Verifies Results** - Confirms no duplicates remain

## Which Record is Kept?

The script keeps the record with the **most recent `updated_at` timestamp**. This ensures you keep the user's latest data (XP, level, squad, etc.).

If two records have the same `updated_at`, it uses `created_at` as a tiebreaker.

## Safety Features

âœ… **Non-destructive in API** - API fix doesn't delete anything  
âœ… **Keeps most recent** - Database cleanup preserves latest user data  
âœ… **Prevents future duplicates** - Adds UNIQUE constraint  
âœ… **Backup available** - Supabase has automatic backups  

## Manual Cleanup (Alternative)

If you want more control over which record to keep:

```sql
-- Example: Keep the user with highest XP
DELETE FROM users 
WHERE wallet_address = 'SPECIFIC_WALLET_HERE'
AND id != (
  SELECT id FROM users 
  WHERE wallet_address = 'SPECIFIC_WALLET_HERE'
  ORDER BY total_xp DESC, updated_at DESC
  LIMIT 1
);
```

## Common Causes of Duplicates

1. **Race Conditions** - Multiple simultaneous user creations
2. **Missing Constraint** - No UNIQUE constraint on wallet_address
3. **Manual Inserts** - Direct database inserts without checking
4. **Import Scripts** - Bulk imports without deduplication

## Prevention

The cleanup script adds a UNIQUE constraint:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD CONSTRAINT users_wallet_address_unique 
UNIQUE (wallet_address);
```

This prevents future duplicates at the database level.

## Testing

### Before Cleanup
```sql
-- Should show duplicates
SELECT wallet_address, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY wallet_address
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### After Cleanup
```sql
-- Should return 0 rows
SELECT wallet_address, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users
GROUP BY wallet_address
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Verify User Count
```sql
-- Check total users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

-- Check unique wallets
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT wallet_address) FROM users;

-- These numbers should now match!
```

## Rollback

If something goes wrong:

1. **Supabase Dashboard â†’ Database â†’ Backups**
2. Select a backup from before you ran the script
3. Click "Restore"

## Summary

âœ… **Immediate Fix** - API deduplication (already applied)  
âœ… **Permanent Fix** - Database cleanup script provided  
âœ… **Prevention** - UNIQUE constraint added  
âœ… **Safe** - Keeps most recent data, backups available  

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Refresh admin dashboard - duplicates should be gone
2. âœ… Run `fix-duplicate-users.sql` in Supabase to clean database
3. âœ… Verify with the test queries above
4. âœ… Monitor for any new duplicates (should be prevented by constraint)

If you see new duplicates after this fix, it means there's an issue with user creation logic that needs investigation.
