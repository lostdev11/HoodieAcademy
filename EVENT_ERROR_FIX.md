# Event Error Fix ✅
**Date:** October 22, 2025

## 🐛 Error

```
Unhandled Runtime Error
TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'targetWallet' of 'event.detail' as it is undefined.
```

**Location:** `src/components/dashboard/UserDashboard.tsx:276`

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `forceRefresh` event was being dispatched as a regular `Event` instead of a `CustomEvent`, so it didn't have a `detail` property. When the event listener tried to destructure `event.detail`, it caused an error.

---

## ✅ Solution

### Fix 1: Change Event Type in DailyLoginBonus

**Before:**
```typescript
// Trigger global refresh
window.dispatchEvent(new Event('forceRefresh')); // ❌ No detail property
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Trigger global refresh with detail
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('forceRefresh', {
  detail: { targetWallet: walletAddress } // ✅ Has detail property
}));
```

---

### Fix 2: Add Safety Check in UserDashboard

**Before:**
```typescript
const handleXpAwarded = (event: CustomEvent) => {
  const { targetWallet } = event.detail; // ❌ Crashes if detail is undefined
  
  if (targetWallet === walletAddress) {
    refreshXP();
  }
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const handleXpAwarded = (event: CustomEvent) => {
  // Safety check for event.detail
  if (!event.detail) { // ✅ Handle missing detail
    console.log('🎯 XP event without detail, refreshing anyway');
    refreshXP();
    return;
  }
  
  const { targetWallet } = event.detail;
  
  if (targetWallet === walletAddress) {
    console.log('🎯 XP awarded, refreshing...');
    refreshXP();
  }
};
```
