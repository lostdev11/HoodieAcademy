# ✅ All Fixes Complete! 🎉
**Date:** October 22, 2025

## 🎯 Summary

All requested fixes have been completed and tested. Here's what was done:

---

## ✅ 1. Debuggers Removed

### What Was Removed
- ❌ **PFP Debugger** from homepage
- ❌ **User Deletion Debugger** from admin dashboard

### Files Modified
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin-dashboard/page.tsx`

### Result

---

## ✅ 2. Daily Claim Countdown Fixed

### Problem
After clicking "Claim Daily Bonus", the countdown timer didn't appear immediately.

### Root Cause
- Timer calculated midnight (wrong) instead of 24 hours from claim time
- Status wasn't reloaded from API after claim

### Solution
```typescript
// OLD (Wrong - midnight reset)
const tomorrow = new Date();
tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);
tomorrow.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

// NEW (Correct - exactly 24 hours)
const now = new Date();
const nextAvailable = new Date(now.getTime() + (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));

// Also reload status from API
setTimeout(async () => {
  await loadStatus();
}, 1000);
```

### Files Modified
- `src/components/xp/DailyLoginBonus.tsx`

### Result
✅ Countdown appears immediately after claiming  
✅ Shows exactly 24 hours until next claim  
✅ Timer updates every second  
✅ No page refresh needed  

---

## ✅ 3. Course API Enhanced (From Earlier)

### What Was Added
- ✅ **Admin sees ALL courses** (published, unpublished, hidden, visible)
- ✅ **Course statistics** showing total, hidden, visible counts
- ✅ **Delete functionality** for removing courses permanently
- ✅ **Enhanced security** with admin verification

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/courses/route.ts`
- `src/components/admin/CourseManagementTab.tsx`

### Result

✅ Hide/show course functionality  
✅ Delete course functionality  
✅ Real-time statistics

## 📋 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Daily Claim Countdown

1. **Go to:** `http://localhost:3001/`
2. **Click:** "Claim Daily Bonus" button
3. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Success toast appears
   - ✅ Countdown timer appears immediately
   - ✅ Shows format: 23:59:59
   - ✅ Timer updates every second
   - ✅ No page refresh needed

### Test 2: Admin Dashboard

3. **Click:** "Courses" tab
4. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Courses load without errors

### Test 3: PFP Display

1. **Run SQL** in Supabase (use `check-and-set-pfp.sql`):
   ```sql
   UPDATE users 
   SET 
     profile_picture = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1472099645785-5658abf4ff4e?w=150&h=150&fit=crop&crop=face',
     squad = NULL
   WHERE wallet_address = 'YOUR_WALLET';
   ```

3. **Check:** Top-right corner of homepage
4. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Your PFP shows (if Academy Member)
   - ✅ Squad badge shows (if in a squad)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### PFP Not Showing?

**Check 1: Are you an Academy Member?**
```sql
SELECT squad FROM users WHERE wallet_address = 'YOUR_WALLET';
-- Should return NULL for PFP to show
```

**Check 2: Do you have a PFP set?**
```sql
SELECT profile_picture FROM users WHERE wallet_address = 'YOUR_WALLET';
-- Should return a URL
```

**Quick Fix:**
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET profile_picture = 'IMAGE_URL', squad = NULL
WHERE wallet_address = 'YOUR_WALLET';
```

### Daily Claim Not Working?

**Check 1: Already claimed today?**
- You can only claim once every 24 hours
- Check countdown timer for next available time

**Check 2: API responsive?**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for network errors
- Check `/api/xp/daily-login` endpoint

### Course API 500 Error?

**Check 1: Using correct port?**
- Use `http://localhost:3001` (not 3000)

**Check 2: Database tables exist?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM courses;
-- Should return number of courses
```
