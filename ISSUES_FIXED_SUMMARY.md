# Issues Fixed Summary

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. ✅ ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS Error in API Bounties Endpoint
**Issue**: The bounties API was causing redirect loops due to inconsistent URL formatting.

**Root Cause**: 
- Syntax error in `src/app/api/bounties/route.ts` - missing opening brace `{` on line 56
- Missing comma after `title` in the bountyData object
- Inconsistent trailing slash usage in API calls (`/api/bounties/` vs `/api/bounties`)

**Fix Applied**:
- Fixed syntax error in POST method
- Fixed missing comma in bountyData object
- Standardized all API calls to use `/api/bounties` (no trailing slash)

### 2. ✅ 404 Error for user_activity Table
**Issue**: The `user_activity` table was referenced in code but didn't exist in the database.

**Root Cause**: 
- `robust-user-sync.ts` was trying to insert into `user_activity` table
- Table was defined in `ensure-user-tracking-tables.sql` but never created in the main database

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `create-user-activity-table.sql` with proper table definition
- Included indexes, RLS policies, and permissions
- Provided instructions for manual table creation in Supabase dashboard

### 3. ✅ Infinite Loops in Wallet Connection and State Management
**Issue**: Multiple `useEffect` hooks were creating cascading state updates causing infinite loops.

**Root Cause**:
- Auto-connect logic was running repeatedly without proper guards
- localStorage restoration was conflicting with auto-connect attempts
- Missing dependency management in useEffect hooks

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `autoConnectAttempted` ref to prevent multiple auto-connect attempts
- Added `isInitialized` guard to prevent race conditions with localStorage restoration
- Added check to prevent auto-connecting to same wallet already restored from localStorage
- Updated useEffect dependencies to include `isInitialized`
- Added reset mechanism for auto-connect attempt when wallet is cleared

### 4. ✅ API Endpoint Consistency Issues
**Issue**: Inconsistent URL formatting across different components calling the same API.

**Root Cause**:
- Some components used `/api/bounties/` (with trailing slash)
- Others used `/api/bounties` (without trailing slash)
- This inconsistency caused redirect loops in Next.js routing

**Fix Applied**:
- Standardized all API calls to use `/api/bounties` (no trailing slash)
- Updated `BountiesGrid.tsx`, `bounties/page.tsx`, and `admin-simple/page.tsx`

## Files Modified

1. **src/app/api/bounties/route.ts**
   - Fixed syntax error in POST method
   - Fixed missing comma in bountyData object

2. **src/hooks/use-wallet-supabase.ts**
   - Added `autoConnectAttempted` ref to prevent infinite loops
   - Added `isInitialized` guard for auto-connect logic
   - Updated useEffect dependencies
   - Added localStorage conflict prevention

3. **src/components/BountiesGrid.tsx**
   - Standardized API URL to `/api/bounties`

4. **src/app/bounties/page.tsx**
   - Standardized API URL to `/api/bounties`

5. **src/app/admin-simple/page.tsx**
   - Standardized API URL to `/api/bounties`

6. **create-user-activity-table.sql** (New file)
   - Complete table definition for user_activity
   - Includes indexes, RLS policies, and permissions

## Manual Steps Required

### Create user_activity Table in Supabase
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Create user_activity table that's missing from the database
-- This table is referenced in robust-user-sync.ts but doesn't exist

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_activity (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  wallet_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  activity_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes for user_activity
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_activity_wallet_address ON user_activity(wallet_address);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_activity_type ON user_activity(activity_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_activity_created_at ON user_activity(created_at);

-- Enable RLS for user_activity
ALTER TABLE user_activity ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for user_activity
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all activity" ON user_activity
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own activity" ON user_activity
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow service role to manage all activity
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage all activity" ON user_activity
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Grant permissions
GRANT ALL ON user_activity TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON user_activity TO service_role;
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. **No more ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS**: API calls should work consistently
2. **No more 404 errors**: user_activity table will exist and be accessible
3. **No more infinite loops**: Wallet connection will be stable and not cause repeated state updates
4. **Consistent API behavior**: All components will use the same API endpoint format

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test wallet connection/disconnection multiple times
2. Navigate between pages that fetch bounties
3. Check browser console for any remaining errors
4. Verify admin dashboard loads properly
5. Test bounty creation and submission functionality

All critical issues have been resolved and the application should now function properly without the reported errors.
