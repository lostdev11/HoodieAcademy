# Countdown Timer Persistence Fix 🔧
**Date:** October 22, 2025

## 🐛 Issue

The countdown timer appeared after claiming but then immediately disappeared back to the "Claim Daily Bonus" button.

### Symptoms
```
1. User clicks "Claim Daily Bonus"
2. Countdown appears: 23:59:59
3. Countdown disappears after 1-2 seconds
4. Back to "Claim Daily Bonus" button
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

Two issues were causing the countdown to disappear:

### Issue 1: Premature Status Reload
After claiming, the component was reloading status from the API after 500ms:
```typescript
setTimeout(async () => {
  await loadStatus(); // ❌ This was overwriting the local state
}, 500);
```

The API response might not have been updated yet, so it returned `alreadyClaimed: false`, which reset the button.

### Issue 2: Auto-Refresh Interference
The auto-refresh interval (every 60 seconds) was also calling `loadStatus()`, which could overwrite the countdown state:
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(loadStatus, 60000); // ❌ Always refreshed
```

---

## ✅ Solution

### Fix 1: Remove Immediate Status Reload

**Before:**
```typescript
setClaiming(false);

// Reload status from API to get accurate nextAvailable time
setTimeout(async () => {
  await loadStatus();
}, 500);
```

**After:**
```typescript
setClaiming(false);

// Don't reload status immediately - let the local state persist
// The countdown will use the calculated nextAvailable time
// Status will refresh naturally via auto-refresh interval
```

**Why This Works:**
- Local state with calculated `nextAvailable` is accurate (24 hours from now)
- No race condition with API
- Countdown persists immediately
- Natural refresh after 60 seconds is fine (countdown will still be running)

---

### Fix 2: Smart Auto-Refresh

**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(loadStatus, 60000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [walletAddress]);
```

**After:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    // Only refresh if not in countdown mode or if countdown has ended
    if (!status?.alreadyClaimed || !timeUntilNext) {
      loadStatus();
    } else {
      console.log('⏸️ Skipping auto-refresh during active countdown');
    }
  }, 60000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [walletAddress, status?.alreadyClaimed, timeUntilNext]);
```

**Why This Works:**
- Checks if countdown is active before refreshing
- Only skips refresh during active countdown
- Still refreshes when button is claimable
- Prevents state overwriting during countdown

## 🔄 New Flow

### After Claiming:
```
1. User clicks "Claim Daily Bonus"
   ⬇️
2. Calculate nextAvailable = now + 24 hours
   ⬇️
3. Update local state:
   - alreadyClaimed: true
   - nextAvailable: "2025-10-23T12:00:00Z"
   ⬇️
4. Dispatch XP update events
   ⬇️
5. Show success notification
   ⬇️
6. Stop claiming state
   ⬇️
7. DON'T reload status (let local state persist)
   ⬇️
8. Countdown starts using local state
   ⬇️
9. Auto-refresh paused during countdown
   ⬇️
10. Countdown runs for 24 hours
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Countdown Persists

1. **Click "Claim Daily Bonus"**
2. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Success notification appears
   - ✅ XP updates immediately
   - ✅ Countdown appears: 23:59:XX
   - ✅ Countdown stays visible
   - ✅ Countdown updates every second
   - ✅ Does NOT disappear back to button

3. **Check Console:**
   ```
   ✅ [DailyLoginBonus] Updating status after claim
   ⏱️ [DailyLoginBonus] Countdown update

   ```

### Test 2: Auto-Refresh Works When Available

   - Auto-refresh works normally every 60 seconds

2. **During countdown:**
   - Auto-refresh is paused
   - Console shows: "Skipping auto-refresh during active countdown"

3. **After countdown ends:**
   - Auto-refresh resumes
   - Status updates when available
