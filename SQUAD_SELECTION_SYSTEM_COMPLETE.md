# ✅ Squad Selection System - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 What Was Built

A comprehensive squad selection system that **forces new users to select their squad before accessing the academy**, with a **30-day locking period** that's stored in the database and enforced across sessions.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Users with wallets but no squad are blocked from accessing ANY page except `/choose-your-squad`
- Beautiful welcome screen greets new users
- Clear explanation of squad benefits and 30-day commitment

### 2. **Database-Backed Squad Storage**

### 3. **30-Day Lock Period**
- Squad selections are locked for 30 days from selection date
- Lock period is calculated and stored in database
- Visual indicators show lock status and remaining days
- Prevents gaming the system
- Users can change squads after 30 days expire

### 4. **Automatic Database Sync**

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

Execute the SQL file in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New Query

# Run the query
```

Or use Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase db execute -f setup-squad-selection-system.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Step 3: Test the Flow

1. **Clear your localStorage** (simulate new user):
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('userSquad');
   ```

2. **Connect wallet** and try to access any page
