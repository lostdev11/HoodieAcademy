## Benefits of Removal

1. **Simplified Interface**: Cleaner, more focused user experience
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer features to maintain and debug
3. **Better Performance**: Less code to load and execute
4. **Focused Learning**: Users can concentrate on course content
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer components and functions to manage

## Testing Results

- âœ… **Build Success**: Application builds without errors
- âœ… **No TypeScript Errors**: All type checking passes
- âœ… **No Linting Errors**: Code quality checks pass
- âœ… **Functionality Preserved**: All non-calendar features work correctly

## Migration Notes

- Existing calendar data in localStorage will be ignored
- No user data was lost (calendar events were not critical user data)
- All other user progress, announcements, and settings remain intact
- Admin users can still manage announcements through the dedicated tab

## Future Considerations

If calendar functionality is needed in the future:
1. The announcement system can be extended to include event-like features
2. External calendar integration could be implemented
3. Simple event scheduling could be added to specific courses
