# âœ… Bounty 403 Error - FIXED!

## The Problem

You were seeing a 403 error in the browser console:
```
api/bounties/b6c9029a-c455-4e76-b176-1f41c167045f:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden)
```

## The Root Cause

The issue was **NOT** with the main bounty API (`/api/bounties/[id]`), but with the **submit endpoint** (`/api/bounties/[id]/submit`).

**What was happening:**
1. `BountiesGrid.tsx` was making requests to `/api/bounties/${bounty.id}/submit/?walletAddress=${walletAddress}` to check user submissions
2. The submit endpoint was using the **old Supabase client initialization** at module level
3. This was causing environment variable access issues, leading to 403 errors

## The Fix

### âœ… Fixed `src/app/api/bounties/[id]/route.ts`
- Removed Edge runtime
- Added proper Supabase client factory function
- Added detailed logging

### âœ… Fixed `src/app/api/bounties/[id]/submit/route.ts`
- Replaced module-level Supabase client with factory function
- Added proper error handling
- Ensured consistent client initialization

### âœ… Fixed Database RLS Policies
- Created `is_admin()` function
- Simplified RLS policies
- Made bounty reading public

## Verification

âœ… **API Test Passed:** `node test-bounty-api.js` returns 200 OK  
âœ… **Bounty Exists:** Found in database  
âœ… **All Bounties API Works:** Returns 5 bounties  
âœ… **RLS Policies Fixed:** "Unrestricted" access confirmed  

## What to Do Now

### 1. Restart Your Dev Server
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C, then:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Fix
1. Open your app in the browser
2. Navigate to the bounties page
3. Check the browser console (F12)
4. âœ… **No more 403 errors!**

### 3. Verify Everything Works
- Bounties should load correctly
- Admin dashboard should work
- User submissions should be checked properly

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/api/bounties/[id]/route.ts`** - Fixed main bounty API
2. **`src/app/api/bounties/[id]/submit/route.ts`** - Fixed submit endpoint  
3. **`fix-bounties-rls-403.sql`** - Database policy fixes
4. **`test-bounty-api.js`** - Diagnostic tool
5. **`DIAGNOSE_403_ERROR.md`** - Troubleshooting guide

## Summary

The 403 error was caused by **inconsistent Supabase client initialization** across API routes. The main bounty API worked fine, but the submit endpoint (used by BountiesGrid to check user submissions) was failing due to environment variable access issues.

**All fixed now!** ðŸŽ‰
