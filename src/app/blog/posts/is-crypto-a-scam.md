# 🧢 Is Crypto a Scam?

I mean… during October it *definitely* felt like it.

But somehow I'm still here.  
Still clicking buttons.  
Still arguing with JPEG holders.

Here's why I'm sticking around 👇

## 1️⃣ It's Not Just Magic Internet Coins

Crypto = emerging tech, not just speculative tokens.

The real juice?  
You can send value **peer to peer** — without a bank, app, or approval delay.

Ever tried sending Venmo to someone who only has Cash App?  
Exactly.

Crypto fixes that. It's open, global, and permissionless.

---

## 2️⃣ Wallets Work Like Email — But Cooler

All you need is a **wallet address**.  
Think: *email for money.*

Even better?  
You can upgrade it to a gamertag with `.sol` or `.eth`.

Example:  
`bongwaterking.sol` exists.  
Yes, someone claimed that.  
Yes, you can send them money *right now.*

## 3️⃣ The Community Is… Weirdly Smart

There's something about NFT communities — especially on **Solana** — that just hits.

Yeah, we meme. Yeah, we cope.  
But also: there are **battle-hardened, brilliant weirdos** here who will help you figure it out.

Especially in places like:  
👉 [@wifhoodie](https://x.com/wifhoodie)  
👉 [@hoodieacademy](https://x.com/hoodieacademy)

## 4️⃣ Everyone Gets Rekt at Least Once

You will lose money.  
You will click the wrong link.  
You will question everything.

But if you survive long enough, you'll start to see the patterns.  
Crypto is earned perspective.

---

## TL;DR

Yes, crypto has scams.  
Yes, it's chaotic.  
But it's also **permissionless, creative, and just getting started.**

Stick around long enough, and you'll see why.

**Next week:**  
I'll show you how to buy your first **WifHoodie NFT** on Magic Eden.  
No fluff. Just real steps.
