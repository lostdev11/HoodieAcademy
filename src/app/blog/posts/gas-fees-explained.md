# Gas Fees Explained (Simply)

If you want an easy way to look like a crypto noob, just ask:

**"Why am I paying gas?"**

Don't worry—everyone has said it at some point.  

Even people who call themselves "Web3 OGs" still don't fully understand gas fees.  

That's why a lot of them stay on Ethereum or ADA *inside Coinbase* and never touch a real wallet.

Let's break this down in plain English.

---

## What Are Gas Fees?

Think of gas like **sales tax**.

Every time you:

- swap a token  
- send crypto  
- buy something on-chain  
- interact with a smart contract  

…you pay a tiny "tax" to the blockchain for doing the work.

This is how the network keeps running.

## Ethereum Gas: The Expensive Grocery Store

On Ethereum, gas works like going to a crowded grocery store where:

- Your $70 groceries come with a **$10 sales tax**  
- The busier the store gets, the *higher* the tax goes  
- Finalizing the purchase takes **2–5 minutes**  

This is Ethereum's model.  

It was revolutionary in 2015, but in 2025? It's old money crypto.

If you're not working with four figures, ETH gas will eat your profits every time you try to make a move.

## The Solana Difference

Solana is the store where the tax is *less than a penny*—no matter how busy it gets.

Why?  

Because Solana scales horizontally, processes transactions in parallel, and stays flat in cost even when the network is booming.

Solana gas fees feel like:

- **fractions of a cent**  
- **instant finality (seconds)**  
- **cheap even during peak congestion**  

You actually get to *keep* your gains instead of watching them disappear into gas fees.

This is why beginners, traders, and builders all gravitate to Solana.  

It's simply the chain that feels like the future.

---

## Why ADA Has Low Fees (Hint: It's Not a Flex)

You might notice ADA also has low gas fees.

Here's the honest reason:

**Nobody uses it.**

Low gas isn't impressive when there's no ecosystem, no usage, no congestion, and no reason to be there.

ADA is the favorite coin of people who have never touched a Web3 wallet and think Coinbase is "on-chain."

Don't be that guy.

## So Which Chain Should Beginners Use?

If you're learning, experimenting, or trading with normal amounts of money:

### 🟩 Solana

- Cheap  
- Fast  
- Active  
- Actually usable  

### 🟥 Ethereum

- Fine for whales  
- Bad for beginners  
- Painful for active trading  
- Expensive for no reason other than history  

### 🟨 ADA  

- Low fees because no one's there  
- Not worth your time unless you enjoy empty rooms

## The Movement

Web3 isn't just "crypto"—it's becoming a real digital economy.

And like any economy, you don't want to spend $5–$50 just to move money around.  

You want:

- fast transactions  
- low overhead  
- a thriving ecosystem  

That's Solana today.

If you want to actually *use* Web3 instead of just reading about it, jump into the ecosystem that works.  

Grab a WifHoodie, join Hoodie Academy, and start learning the chain that won't drain your wallet every time you click "swap."
