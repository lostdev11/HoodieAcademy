# Squad Selection System Update

## Overview
Removed the placement test and replaced it with direct squad selection while maintaining the 30-day locking period to prevent gaming the system.

## What Changed

### üéØ Direct Squad Selection
- **Before**: Users took a personality quiz to be assigned to a squad
- **After**: Users directly choose their squad based on their interests and goals

### üîí 30-Day Locking Period (MAINTAINED)
- Users are locked into their chosen squad for **30 days**
- Lock end date is stored with the squad selection
- Visual indicators show lock status and remaining days
- Users cannot change squads during the lock period
- After 30 days, users can freely change their squad

## Files Updated

### 1. Squad Storage Utility (`src/utils/squad-storage.ts`)
**New Features:**
- Added `lockEndDate` to `SquadData` interface
- Added `isSquadLocked()` function to check if squad is currently locked
- Added `getRemainingLockDays()` function to calculate remaining lock days

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
// Store squad with 30-day lock
const lockEndDate = new Date();
lockEndDate.setDate(lockEndDate.getDate() + 30);
storeSquad({ 
  name: 'Hoodie Creators', 
  id: 'creators',
  lockEndDate: lockEndDate.toISOString()
});

// Check if locked
const locked = isSquadLocked(); // Returns true/false

// Get remaining days
const days = getRemainingLockDays(); // Returns number of days
```

### 2. Choose Your Squad Page (`src/app/choose-your-squad/page.tsx`)
**Enhancements:**
- Now shows current squad status at the top of the page
- Displays lock status with visual indicators:
  - üü† **Orange badge**: Squad is locked (shows remaining days)
  - üü¢ **Green badge**: Squad is unlocked (can change)
- Prevents squad changes during lock period with helpful error message
- Stores lock end date when squad is selected
- Updated page title based on whether user has a squad or not

### 3. Profile View (`src/components/profile/ProfileView.tsx`)
**Updates:**
- Changed "Take Placement Test" ‚Üí "Choose Your Squad"
- Changed "Retake Placement Test" ‚Üí "Change Squad"
- Updated all links from `/placement/squad-test` to `/choose-your-squad`
- Updated messaging to reflect direct selection instead of testing

### 4. Onboarding Flow (`src/components/OnboardingFlow.tsx`)
**Updates:**
- Changed step title from "Find Your Squad" ‚Üí "Choose Your Squad"
- Updated description from testing language to selection language
- Changed button from "Take Squad Placement Test" ‚Üí "Choose Your Squad"
- Updated link to `/choose-your-squad`

### 5. Squad Chat Client (`src/app/squads/[squad]/chat/SquadChatClient.tsx`)
**Updates:**
- Changed all placement test references to squad selection
- Updated error messages to refer to choosing instead of testing
- Changed button text from "Take Squad Test" ‚Üí "Choose Squad"
- Changed "Retake Squad Test" ‚Üí "Change Squad"

### 6. Lore Narrative Crafting Page (`src/app/lore-narrative-crafting/page.tsx`)
**Updates:**

- Updated link to `/choose-your-squad`

## How It Works

### First-Time Squad Selection
1. User navigates to `/choose-your-squad`
2. User sees all 5 squads with detailed information:
   - üé® **Hoodie Creators** - Content creators and artists
   - üß† **Hoodie Decoders** - Technical analysts and researchers
   - üé§ **Hoodie Speakers** - Community leaders and moderators
   - ‚öîÔ∏è **Hoodie Raiders** - Traders and strategists
   - ü¶Ö **Hoodie Rangers** - Elite path (locked until all tracks complete)
3. User selects a squad (clicks on card)
4. Confirmation dialog appears explaining 30-day lock period
5. User confirms selection
6. Squad is stored with lock end date (30 days from now)
7. User is redirected to home page

### Changing Squads (After 30 Days)
1. User navigates to `/choose-your-squad`
2. Current squad status card appears at top showing:
   - Current squad information
   - Green "Squad Unlocked" badge (if 30 days passed)
3. User can select a new squad
4. New 30-day lock period begins

### Attempting to Change During Lock Period
1. User navigates to `/choose-your-squad`
2. Current squad status card shows:
   - Current squad information
   - Orange "Squad Locked" badge with remaining days
3. User attempts to select a different squad
4. Alert appears: "You are currently locked into [Squad Name] for [X] more days"
5. Selection is blocked until lock expires

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Improved User Experience
- **More autonomy**: Users choose their path rather than being assigned
- **Clear information**: All squad details visible before selection
- **Transparent locking**: Visual indicators show exact lock status

### ‚úÖ System Integrity Maintained
- **30-day lock** prevents gaming the system
- **Stored lock dates** ensure enforcement across sessions
- **Visual feedback** helps users understand restrictions

### ‚úÖ Better Alignment
- Users select based on actual interests and goals
- More likely to engage with their chosen track
- Reduces mismatches from quiz results

## Elite Squad: Hoodie Rangers

The **Hoodie Rangers** remain locked until users complete all 4 core squad tracks:
- This ensures mastery before accessing elite content
- Represents the highest level of achievement
- Users attempting to select it see: "Hoodie Rangers is locked! Complete all 4 core squad tracks to unlock this elite path."

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface SquadData {
  name: string;              // Squad name (e.g., "Hoodie Creators")
  id: string;                // Squad ID (e.g., "creators")
  lockEndDate?: string;      // ISO date string for when lock expires
}
```

### Storage Location
- **localStorage key**: `userSquad`
- **Format**: JSON string
- **Persistence**: Survives page refreshes and sessions

### Lock Calculation
```typescript
// Calculate lock end date
const lockEndDate = new Date();
lockEndDate.setDate(lockEndDate.getDate() + 30);

// Check if still locked
const now = new Date();
const isLocked = now < new Date(squad.lockEndDate);

// Calculate remaining days
const diffTime = lockEndDate.getTime() - now.getTime();
const remainingDays = Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
```

## Migration from Old System

### For Existing Users
- Users who previously took the placement test keep their current squad
- If they don't have a `lockEndDate`, they can change squads immediately
- Next time they select a squad, the 30-day lock will apply

### For New Users
- See the direct selection page
- Choose their squad based on interests
- 30-day lock begins immediately

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Admin override**: Allow admins to unlock users early
2. **Progress tracking**: Show completion % for each squad's track
3. **Squad recommendations**: Suggest squads based on completed courses
4. **Lock notifications**: Email/notification when lock expires
5. **Squad stats**: Show number of users in each squad
