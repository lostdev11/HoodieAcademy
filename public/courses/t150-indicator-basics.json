It's one of the most reliable indicators for identifying overbought and oversold conditions.\n\n**RSI Basics:**\nâ€¢ Range: 0 to 100\nâ€¢ Overbought: Above 70\nâ€¢ Oversold: Below 30\nâ€¢ Neutral: 30-70 range\nâ€¢ Default period: 14\n\n**RSI Interpretation:**\nâ€¢ Above 70 = potentially overbought\nâ€¢ Below 30 = potentially oversold\nâ€¢ Centerline (50) = momentum balance\nâ€¢ Divergence = potential reversal\nâ€¢ Failure swings = trend continuation\n\n**Why RSI Works:**\nâ€¢ Measures momentum\nâ€¢ Identifies extremes\nâ€¢ Shows divergence\nâ€¢ Confirms trends\nâ€¢ Provides entry/exit signals",
