          "content": "A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional bank accounts, crypto wallets give you complete control over your funds.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\nâ€¢ **Private Keys**: Secret codes that prove ownership of your crypto\nâ€¢ **Public Addresses**: Public identifiers others use to send you crypto\nâ€¢ **Seed Phrases**: Backup words to recover your wallet\nâ€¢ **Non-Custodial**: You control your keys, not a bank\n\n**Security Principle**: Whoever controls the private keys controls the cryptocurrency. This is why wallet security is absolutely critical.",
