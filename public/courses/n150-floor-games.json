          "content": "**Laddering** is a strategic approach to placing multiple bids or listings at different price levels to maximize your chances of success.\n\n**Bid Laddering:**\nâ€¢ Place bids at 0.1 SOL intervals below floor\nâ€¢ Example: Floor at 2.0 SOL, bid at 1.9, 1.8, 1.7\nâ€¢ Increases chances of getting filled\nâ€¢ Creates multiple support levels\nâ€¢ Allows for price discovery\n\n**Listing Laddering:**\nâ€¢ List NFTs at different price points\nâ€¢ Example: List at floor, +0.1, +0.2, +0.3\nâ€¢ Catches buyers at different price levels\nâ€¢ Maximizes profit potential\nâ€¢ Reduces risk of missing sales\n\n**Strategic Benefits:**\nâ€¢ **Higher Fill Rate**: More chances to get filled\nâ€¢ **Price Discovery**: Find where market wants to trade\nâ€¢ **Risk Management**: Don't put all eggs in one basket\nâ€¢ **Market Making**: Provide liquidity to the market\n\n**Pro Tips:**\nâ€¢ Start with small amounts to test the market\nâ€¢ Monitor which levels get filled most\nâ€¢ Adjust ladder spacing based on volatility\nâ€¢ Consider gas fees when placing multiple bids",
