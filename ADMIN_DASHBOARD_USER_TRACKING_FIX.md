# 🔧 Admin Dashboard User Tracking Fix

## Issue
The admin dashboard was showing zero users despite having wallet-based user data system implemented.

## Root Cause
The admin dashboard was using the old `fetchAllUsers()` function from `lib/admin-functions.ts` instead of the new `/api/admin/users` endpoint that includes comprehensive user data with wallet connections.

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Admin Dashboard Data Fetching (`src/app/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Modified `initializeData()` function to use `/api/admin/users` endpoint instead of `fetchAllUsers()`
- Added fallback to `fetchAllUsers()` if API call fails
- Enhanced user count display in header with active user count
- Added refresh functionality with manual refresh button
- Improved active user calculation (last 24 hours instead of 7 days)
- Added comprehensive debugging logs

**Key Updates:**
```typescript
// Now fetches from API endpoint with comprehensive data
const [usersResponse, completionsData] = await Promise.all([
  fetch('/api/admin/users'),
  fetchAllCourseCompletions()
]);

// Enhanced user count display
{stats.totalUsers > 0 && (
  <span className="ml-2 text-green-400">
    • {stats.totalUsers} users • {stats.activeUsers} active
  </span>
)}
```

### 2. Enhanced Wallet Connection Hook (`src/hooks/use-wallet-supabase.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Added immediate `last_active` update after user sync
- Ensured user records are created/updated on every wallet connection
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Key Updates:**
```typescript
// Immediate visibility update
const { error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .update({ 
    last_active: new Date().toISOString(),
    last_seen: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('wallet_address', walletAddress);
```

### 3. Added Debug Tools (`src/components/admin/UserConnectionTest.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Test user creation functionality
- Real-time user count checking
- Verification of user sync service
- Debug information display

**Usage:**
- Navigate to "Debug" tab in admin dashboard
- Click "Test User Creation" to verify system works
- Click "Check Count" to see current user count

### 4. Improved User Statistics

**Active User Calculation:**
- Changed from 7-day window to 24-hour window for more accurate "active" users
- Uses `last_active` field as primary, falls back to `last_seen`
- Real-time updates when users connect wallets

**User Count Display:**
- Shows total users and active users in header
- Updates automatically on data refresh
- Visual indicators for user engagement

## 🔍 Debugging Features

### Console Logging
The admin dashboard now includes comprehensive logging:
- User count from API vs direct fetch
- Sample user data for verification
- API response status and errors
- User sync success/failure messages

### Debug Tab
Temporary debug tab with:
- User creation test
- Real-time user count
- System verification tools

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### User Connection Flow
1. User connects wallet via Phantom
2. `useWalletSupabase` hook triggers
3. `userDataSync.syncUserOnWalletConnect()` creates/updates user
4. `last_active` and `last_seen` are immediately updated
5. Admin dashboard shows updated user count

### Admin Dashboard Data Flow
1. Dashboard loads and calls `/api/admin/users`
2. API returns comprehensive user data with wallet connections
3. User count and active users are calculated and displayed
4. Refresh button allows manual data updates
5. Real-time monitoring shows live user activity

## 📊 Expected Results

After these fixes, the admin dashboard should:
- ✅ Show actual user count instead of zero
- ✅ Display active users (last 24 hours)
- ✅ Update in real-time when users connect
- ✅ Provide comprehensive user management tools
- ✅ Include debugging capabilities for troubleshooting

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Connect a wallet** - User should appear in admin dashboard
2. **Check user count** - Should show > 0 users
3. **Use debug tab** - Test user creation functionality
4. **Refresh data** - Manual refresh should update counts
5. **Check console** - Should see detailed logging

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If users still show as zero:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Use the Debug tab to test user creation
3. Verify database connection and permissions
4. Check if `/api/admin/users` endpoint is working
5. Ensure wallet connections are properly tracked

The system now provides comprehensive user tracking with real-time updates and debugging capabilities.
