# üßä S100 ‚Äì Cold Truths of Self-Custody

## Course Overview

**"Cold Truths of Self-Custody"** is a comprehensive 100-level survival class that teaches the brutal reality of self-custody security. This course shatters the myth that cold storage is "set and forget" and prepares students for the harsh realities of protecting their own crypto assets.

### Course Philosophy

This course operates on the principle that **ignorance is not bliss** when it comes to crypto security. Students learn that:

- **Cold wallets are not forever** - they require active maintenance
- **Human error equals finality** - one mistake can lose everything
- **Security has hidden costs** - time, redundancy, and patience
- **Recovery plans matter** - disasters happen to everyone
- **Sovereignty is a skill, not a setting** - continuous learning required

- **The Setup**: Single hardware wallet, single paper backup
- **The Disaster**: Device failure, lost backup, no documentation
- **The Aftermath**: Permanent loss, emotional impact, family stress
- **What Went Wrong**: Single points of failure, poor planning
- **Recovery Lessons**: Multiple devices, multiple backups, documentation

#### Lesson 4.2: Disaster Recovery Planning
