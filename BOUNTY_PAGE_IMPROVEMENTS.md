## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Integration

#### Image Upload API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/upload/moderated-image`
- **Method**: POST
- **Form Data**:
  - `file`: The image file
  - `walletAddress`: User's wallet address (from localStorage)
  - `context`: 'bounty_submission'
- **Response**: Returns image URL for submission

#### Bounty Submission API
- **Endpoint**: `/api/bounties/[id]/submit/`
- **Method**: POST
- **JSON Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "submission": "text content",
    "walletAddress": "user_wallet_address",
    "submissionType": "text" | "image" | "both",
    "imageUrl": "uploaded_image_url" (optional)
  }
  ```

### Flow:
1. User selects image → Auto-uploads to moderation system
2. Image URL is stored in component state
3. User clicks submit → Both text and image URL sent to API
4. API saves submission with image reference
5. Admin can review both text and image in admin dashboard
