# ðŸ”— Wallet-Based User Data System Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive wallet-based user data system has been implemented for the Hoodie Academy platform. This system automatically tracks user activities, manages profiles, and provides detailed analytics for administrators based on wallet connections.

## âœ… Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Wallet Connection Hook (`src/hooks/use-wallet-supabase.ts`)

**Key Features:**
- Automatic user record creation/update on first wallet connection
- Enhanced wallet connection tracking with device and session data
- Integration with the new user data sync service
- Backward compatibility with existing logging systems

**What happens on wallet connection:**
1. Wallet connects via Phantom
2. Enhanced connection data is tracked (device info, session data, metadata)
3. User record is automatically created/updated in database
4. XP record is initialized if it doesn't exist
5. All activities are logged for admin monitoring

### 2. Comprehensive User Data Sync Service (`src/lib/user-data-sync.ts`)

**Core Functionality:**
- `syncUserOnWalletConnect()` - Main sync function called on wallet connection
- `ensureUserProfile()` - Creates/updates user profiles
- `ensureUserXP()` - Initializes XP tracking
- `trackUserActivity()` - Logs all user activities
- `updateUserProfile()` - Updates user information
- `recordCourseCompletion()` - Tracks course completions
- `recordBountySubmission()` - Tracks bounty submissions
- `addXP()` - Manages XP rewards
- `getUserDataForAdmin()` - Comprehensive data for admin dashboard

**Data Tracked:**
- User profiles (display name, squad, bio, username, admin status)
- XP progression (total, bounty, course, streak XP)
- Activity logs (all user actions with timestamps and metadata)
- Wallet connections (device info, session data, verification results)
- Course completions and bounty submissions

### 3. Admin Dashboard Integration

#### Wallet Insights Tab (`src/app/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
Added a new "Wallet Insights" tab with four sub-tabs:

1. **User Insights** (`src/components/admin/WalletUserInsights.tsx`)
   - Comprehensive user management interface
   - Real-time stats (total users, active users, connections, XP, profile completion)
   - Advanced filtering and search capabilities
   - User detail modals with activity history
   - Wallet connection tracking per user

2. **Real-time Monitor** (`src/components/admin/RealtimeUserMonitor.tsx`)
   - Live activity feed with auto-refresh
   - Real-time connection monitoring
   - Event filtering and search
   - Live statistics dashboard
   - Pause/resume monitoring controls

3. **Profile Manager** (`src/components/admin/UserProfileManager.tsx`)
   - Edit user profiles directly from admin dashboard
   - Update display names, squads, bios, usernames
   - Modify admin status
   - Profile completion tracking
   - Bulk user management capabilities

4. **Analytics** (`src/components/admin/WalletAnalytics.tsx`)
   - Comprehensive analytics dashboard
   - Time-range filtering (24h, 7d, 30d, 90d)
   - Provider breakdown (Phantom, MetaMask, etc.)
   - Squad distribution analysis
   - XP distribution charts
   - Connection trend analysis
   - User activity insights

### 4. Database Integration

**Tables Used:**
- `users` - Main user profiles
- `user_xp` - XP tracking and leveling
- `user_activity` - Activity logging
- `wallet_connections` - Connection tracking
- `bounty_submissions` - Bounty participation
- `course_completions` - Course progress

**Key Features:**
- Automatic data synchronization
- Real-time updates
- Comprehensive activity tracking
- Admin-level data access
- Performance optimized queries

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Wallet Connection Flow
1. User connects wallet via Phantom
2. `useWalletSupabase` hook triggers
3. Enhanced connection data is captured
4. `userDataSync.syncUserOnWalletConnect()` is called
5. User profile is created/updated
6. XP record is initialized
7. Activity is logged
8. Admin dashboard is updated in real-time

### Data Flow
```
Wallet Connection â†’ Enhanced Tracking â†’ User Sync â†’ Database Update â†’ Admin Dashboard
```

### Admin Dashboard Features
