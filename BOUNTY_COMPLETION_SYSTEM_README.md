# Bounty Completion System

This system tracks when users complete bounties by having their submissions approved by admins. When a bounty submission is approved, the system automatically marks the bounty as completed for that user and awards the appropriate XP.

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema

### user_bounty_completions Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_bounty_completions (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  wallet_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  bounty_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  submission_id UUID NOT NULL,
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  xp_awarded INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  sol_prize DECIMAL(10, 8) DEFAULT 0,
  placement TEXT CHECK (placement IN ('first', 'second', 'third')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(wallet_address, bounty_id)
);
```

### Database Function

The `mark_bounty_completed` function handles:
- Checking if the bounty exists
- Preventing duplicate completions
- Recording the completion
- Awarding XP to the user

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mark_bounty_completed(
  p_wallet_address TEXT,
  p_bounty_id TEXT,
  p_submission_id UUID,
  p_xp_awarded INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
  p_sol_prize DECIMAL(10, 8) DEFAULT 0,
  p_placement TEXT DEFAULT NULL
)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
```

## üéØ User Tracking Integration

}
```

### New Hook Functions
